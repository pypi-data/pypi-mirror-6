<h1>Summary</h1>

<p class="lead">This is a tool for analysis of current state of projects and tracking changes over time.<br>
It will allow us to become more predictable and realistic, visualise progress for ours and other stakeholders' benefit and help addressing
potential issues preemptively.<br>
We're awesome, but will become more so. 
</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
	<dt>Projects</dt>
	<dd>Dashboard with all projects(sprints) and a Gantt chart showing dependencies</dd>
	<dt>People</dt>
	<dd>Shows involvement of everyone over time, across projects - this shows potential overallocation/underallocation</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Assumptions and limitations</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Projects are small, i.e. more like few weeks long sprints</li>
	<li>Tasks within projects are granular and should not contain more than 3-5 man days of effort</li>
	<li>Every task is assigned to someone</li>
	<li>Tasks are ordered according to priority and team members pick the most important ones first</li> 
	<li>Estimation of tasks is done at the beginning of the project (agile poker?) and is updated throughout it</li>
	<li>Estimated finish date for project(sprint) is calculated based on critical path. Critical path can be created by a person (based on assigned tasks) or sequence of tasks (sequences can be defined to show dependency of tasks)</li> 
	<li>Every activity of every team member has its corresponding task</li>
	<li>It doesn't matter where task definitions are stored, however at the moment we're using some hosted systems imposed by 3rd parties</li>
	<li>TestTrack and future company wide systems should be integrated and tracked</li>
</ul>

<h1>Integrations</h1>
<h2>Trello</h2>
<p>Tags to include in names of Trello's tasks
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
	<dt>[eff:X]</dt>
	<dd><span class="strong">Exactly 1 required.</span><br>
	Estimated effort for the task. X is expressed in man days, e.g. [eff:0.5] is half a day.<br>
	Assigning more than 1 person to the task lowers duration accordingly, e.g. assigning 2 people to .5d task will assign .25d duration task to both of them.
	</dd>
	<dt>[res:RESOURCE]</dt>
	<dd>Optional, task can have many of them.<br>
	Some people or groups of people (e.g. 3rd parties, Creative Services) won't have Trello accounts,
	so instead of assigning member to a task, include as many res tags as necessary. This is equivalent of assigning a member.</dd>
	<dt>[seq:SEQUENCE]</dt>
	<dd>Optional, task can have many of them.<br>
	This can be used to indicate, that tasks have to be executed in sequence.
	This way sequence can end up being on the critical path.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>TestTrack</h2>
todo

<h1>Todo</h1>
<ul>
<li>integrate with TestTrack</li>
<li>implement people involvement calculation and detection of overallocation</li>
<li>50/90 dates - take risk into account</li>
<li>ability to change risk of projects (sprints) in time</li>
</ul>
