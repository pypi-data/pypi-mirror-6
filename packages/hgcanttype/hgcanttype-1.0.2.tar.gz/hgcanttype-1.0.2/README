hg-canttype: mercurial extension for bad typists
================================================

Corrects simple typing errors in commands using
`Damerau-Levenshtein distance <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerauâ€“Levenshtein_distance>`_.

Ever typed `hg dfif`, `hg doff` or `hg banrch`? This fixes that.


Some examples of how it helps::

    $ hg dfif
    Correcting 'dfif' to 'diff'

    $ hg brnch
    Correcting 'brnch' to 'branch'


Installation & Setup
--------------------

Installing hg-canttype is simple::

    $ pip install hgcanttype


Setup is easy too, just add hgcanttype to your hgrc::

    [extensions]
    hgcanttype=

You can configure the distance to consider a command "close enough" like so::

    [canttype]
    distance = 5


The default is 1. Take note that setting the distance too high is a bad idea::

    $ hg dfif
    Correcting 'dfif' to 'help'
