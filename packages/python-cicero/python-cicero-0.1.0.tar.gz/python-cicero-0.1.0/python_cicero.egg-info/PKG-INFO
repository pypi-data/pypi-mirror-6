Description: =============
        Python-Cicero
        =============
        
        Python-Cicero provides a Pythonic "wrapper" to `Azavea's Cicero API <http://www.azavea.com/cicero/>`_
        for address-based legislative and non-legislative district matching, lookup of
        elected official contact information, and election events.
        
        Note: Be sure to take a look at `the project page on Github <http://github.com/azavea/python-cicero/>`_.
        
        Installation / Setup
        ********************
        
        Use pip to install the library:
        
            pip install python-cicero
            
        If you anticipate making improvements/extensions and would like to document
        them, use the extras_require convention to also install the Pycco documentation
        generator as a dependency (see Documentation section below):
            
            pip install python-cicero['docs']
            
        To make requests to the Cicero API, you will need a Cicero account. A free
        trial of the API is available by registering `here <http://www.azavea.com/products/cicero/free-trial/>`_. The process for
        purchasing additional API credits is described on the Cicero website.
        
        **Testing**
        
        There are a few ways to run the unit tests.
        
        One option is to use the shell script in the root of the repository
        called *test.example.sh*. Copy it using ``cp test.example.sh test.sh``.
        Edit *test.sh* to include your Cicero API username and password. Then, run
        the tests using ``./test.sh``.
        
        Another option is to edit the ``test/tests.py`` file directly, adding your
        Cicero API credentials where indicated. Doing so will allow you to execute
        tests using ``nosetests`` (if you have the nose package installed), or
        using ``python setup.py test``, or invoking the ``tests.py`` file itself.
        
        Documentation
        *************
        
        Documentation, generated with `Pycco <http://fitzgen.github.io/pycco/>`_, is
        available in the "docs" folder as HTML files. The filenames correspond to the
        appropriate module being documented.
        
        For examples of the wrapper in use, see the ``cicero_examples.py`` file.
