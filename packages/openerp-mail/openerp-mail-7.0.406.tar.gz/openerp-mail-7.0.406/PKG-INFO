        Business oriented Social Networking
        ===================================
        The Social Networking module provides a unified social network abstraction layer allowing applications to display a complete
        communication history on documents with a fully-integrated email and message management system.
        
        It enables the users to read and send messages as well as emails. It also provides a feeds page combined to a subscription mechanism that allows to follow documents and to be constantly updated about recent news.
        
        Main Features
        -------------
        * Clean and renewed communication history for any OpenERP document that can act as a discussion topic
        * Subscription mechanism to be updated about new messages on interesting documents
        * Unified feeds page to see recent messages and activity on followed documents
        * User communication through the feeds page
        * Threaded discussion design on documents
        * Relies on the global outgoing mail server - an integrated email management system - allowing to send emails with a configurable scheduler-based processing engine
        * Includes an extensible generic email composition assistant, that can turn into a mass-mailing assistant and is capable of interpreting simple *placeholder expressions* that will be replaced with dynamic data when each email is actually sent.
