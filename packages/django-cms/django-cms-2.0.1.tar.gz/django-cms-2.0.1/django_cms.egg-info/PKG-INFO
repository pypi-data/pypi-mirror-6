Description: Django CMS 2.0
        ==============
        
        A Django app for managing hierarchical pages of content in multiple languages, on different sites.
        
        Django CMS handles the navigation rendering for you in multiple languages with internationalization (i18n) slugs,
        and the navigation can be extended by your own models.
        
        Pages are rendered with a template that has placeholders which get filled via plugins.
        Plugins included at the moment include the following:
        
        * File
        * Flash
        * Google Map
        * Link
        * Picture
        * HTML Snippet
        * Teaser
        * Text
        * Video
        * Twitter
        
        Many more are in the works.  Plugins are very easy to write and integrate with your own models.
