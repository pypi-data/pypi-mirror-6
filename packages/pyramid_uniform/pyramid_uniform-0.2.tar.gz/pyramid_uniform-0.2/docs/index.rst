Form Handling and Rendering for Pyramid
=======================================

Scott Torborg - `Cart Logic <http://www.cartlogic.com>`_

Form rendering and validation for Pyramid. Doesn't render HTML itself, so you
have full control over form markup.

Heavily inspired by the ``pyramid_simpleform`` package, rewritten to work with
WebHelpers2 and Python 3 and fix some issues with the original.
