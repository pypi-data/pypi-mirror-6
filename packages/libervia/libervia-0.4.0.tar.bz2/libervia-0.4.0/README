All the credits are the same than the ones for "Salut à Toi", as it is a global project.

A big big thank to the authors/contributors of...

proxy65:
SàT (plugin_xep_0065) use nearly all the code from proxy65 (http://code.google.com/p/proxy65/) which was coded by Dave Smith (2002-2004) and maintained by Fabio Forno (2007-2008).
As the original MIT licence allow, the code is reused and sub-licenced until GPL v3 to follow the rest of the code.

progressbar:
SàT (jp) use ProgressBar (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar/2.2), a class coded by Nilton Volpato which allow the textual representation of progression.

twisted:
SàT is heavily based on the twisted framework (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/), a very great tool which offer a lot of protocols management. There are too many contributors to name them here, so take a look on the website :).

wokkel:
SàT use a library with high level enhancements on top of twisted, which is called wokkel (http://wokkel.ik.nu). Lot of thanks to Ralph Meijer and all other contributors.

wxWidgets & wxPython:
The Wix frontend is made with wxWidgets (www.wxwidgets.org) and its python version wxPython (wxPython), which is a really handy UI toolkit who works on most popular platforms. It can be found on probably all major Gnu/Linux distributions.

Urwid:
Primitivus is based on Urwid (http://excess.org/urwid/) which saved me a lot of time. It's really a great library to easily make a sophisticated interface.

Pyjamas:
Libervia is built with a Pyjamas (http://pyjs.org), a Google Web Toolkit port for python, including Python to Javascript compiler, and Pyjamas Desktop which allow to execute the same application on the desktop or through a browser. It's really an amazing tool.

Pyfeed and Xe:
SàT core and Libervia use pyfeed and xe (http://www.blarg.net/%7Esteveha/), 2 libraries made Steve R. Hastings really useful to parse/generate xml stuff as atom feeds.

txJSON-RPC:
Libervia use txJSON-RPC (https://launchpad.net/txjsonrpc), a twisted library to communicate with the browser's javascript throught JSON-RPC

Mutagen:
Mutagen (https://code.google.com/p/mutagen/) is an audio metadata handling library, it's use by the radiocol plugin.

pictures found in frontends/src/wix/images/crystal/:
These pictures come from Crystal clear, were made by Everaldo Coelho (www.everaldo.com) and YellowIcon (www.yellowicon.com). They are under LGPL V3 licence (see frontends/src/wix/images/COPYING.LESSER).
Found on http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png and http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Crystal_Clear_app_cache.png

pictures found in frontends/src/wix/images/cards/ and /public/cards in Libervia:
The Tarot cards pictures come from the deck found on wikicommons (the script used to cut them is available at frontend/src/wix/images/split_card.sh), and available at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Tarotcards.jpg under Creative Commons BY-SA. The authors shown on the site are Piast and Svick. The splitted cards are, according to the licence, available under the same conditions.

the powerfull ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/) is used by the script written to split the previously named picture.

and the others:
and of course, nothing would be possible without Python (http://www.python.org/), GNU and the Free Software Foundation (http://www.gnu.org, http://www.fsf.org/), the Linux Kernel (http://www.kernel.org/), and the coder of the tools I use like Vim (http://www.vim.org/), Mercurial (http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/), or all the KDE stuff (http://www.kde.org/ and of course http://amarok.kde.org/), and also XFCE (http://www.xfce.org), etc. Thanks thanks thanks, thanks to everybody in the Free (Libre) chain for making a part of the dream.

If I forgot any credit (and I probably have), please contact me (mail below) to fix it.
