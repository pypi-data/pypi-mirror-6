class TableList(Widget):
    '''A tablelist widget is a multi-column listbox.  

    The width of each column can be dynamic (i.e., just large enough to hold all its elements, 
    including the header) or static (specified in characters or pixels).  The columns are, per
    default, resizable.  The alignment of each column can be specified as left, right, or center.

    The columns, rows, and cells can be configured individually.  Several of the global and 
    column-specific options refer to the headers, implemented as label widgets.  For instance, 
    the -labelcommand option specifies a Tcl command to be invoked when mouse button 1 is released over
    a label.  The most common value of this option is tablelist::sortByColumn, which sorts the items 
    based on the respective column.

    Interactive editing of the elements of a tablelist widget can be enabled for individual cells and 
    for entire columns.  A great variety of widgets from the Tk core and from the packages BWidget, 
    Iwidgets, combobox, and Mentry is supported for being used as embedded edit window.  In addition, 
    a rich set of keyboard bindings is provided for a comfortable navigation between the editable cells.

    The Tcl command corresponding to a tablelist widget is very similar to the one associated with a 
    normal listbox.  There are column-, row-, and cell-specific counterparts of the configure and cget 
    subcommands (columnconfigure, rowconfigure, cellconfigure, ...).  They can be used, among others, 
    to insert images into the cells and the header labels, or to insert embedded windows into the cells.  
    The index, nearest, and see command options refer to the rows, but similar subcommands are provided
    for the columns and cells (columnindex, cellindex, ...).  The items can be sorted with the sort and
    sortbycolumn command options.

    The bindings defined for the body of a tablelist widget make it behave just like a normal listbox.
    This includes the support for the virtual event <<ListboxSelect>> 
    (which is equivalent to <<TablelistSelect>>).  In addition, version 2.3 or higher of the widget 
    callback package Wcb (written in pure Tcl/Tk code as well) can be used to define callbacks for the 
    activate,  selection set,  and  selection clear  commands, and Wcb version 3.0 or higher also 
    supports callbacks for the activatecell,  cellselection set,  and  cellselection clear  commands.  
    The download location of Wcb is

        CELL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

        The following options are currently supported by the cellcget
        and cellconfigure commands:

        -background color or -bg color
            Specifies the normal background color to use when displaying
            the contents of the cell.

        -editable boolean
            Specifies whether the contents of the cell can be edited 
            interactively.  The default value is 0.  This option 
            overrides the one with the same name for the column 
            containing the given cell.

        -font font
            Specifies the font to use when displaying the contents
            of the cell.

        -foreground color or -fg color
            Specifies the normal foreground color to use when 
            displaying the contents of the cell.

        -image image
            Specifies the name of the Tk image to be displayed in the
            cell.  image must be the result of an invocation of the  
            image create  command, or an empty string, specifying that
            no image is to be displayed.  If the column containing the 
            cell is right-aligned then the image will be displayed to 
            the right of the cell"s text, otherwise to its left.  The 
            text and the image are separated from each other by a 
            space character.  If for the same cell the -window option 
            was specified with a nonempty value then it overrides the 
            -image option.  If the tablelist"s state is disabled then 
            this option will be ignored.

            To display an image in a cell, Tablelist makes use of an 
            embedded label widget.  This requires more memory than 
            inserting the image directly into the tablelist"s body, but
            has the main advantage of making it possible to adjust the 
            width of the label containing the widget to fit into its 
            column.  This has the visual effect of cutting off part of 
            the image from its right or left side, depending on the 
            column"s alignment.&nbspM; To make sure that images with 
            transparent background will be dispklayed correctly, the 
            background color of the label widgets containing the 
            embedded images is automatically updated whenever necessary.

        -selectbackground color
            Specifies the background color to use when displaying the 
            contents of the cell while it is selected.

        -selectforeground color
            Specifies the foreground color to use when displaying the 
            contents of the cell while it is selected.

        -text text
            Specifies the string to be displayed in the given cell, 
            i.e., updates the element contained in the cell.  If the 
            tablelist"s state is disabled then this option will be 
            ignored.

        -window command
            Specifies a Tcl command creating the window to be embedded
            into the cell.  The command is automatically concatenated 
            with the name of the tablelist widget, the cell"s row and 
            column indices, as well as the path name of the embedded 
            window to be created, and the resulting script is evaluated
            in the global scope.  command may also be an empty string, 
            specifying that no embedded window is to be displayed.  If 
            the column containing the cell is right-aligned then the 
            window will be displayed to the right of the cell"s text, 
            otherwise to its left.  The text and the window are 
            separated from each other by a space character.  If this 
            option was specified with a nonempty value then it 
            overrides the -image cell configuration option.  If the 
            tablelist"s state is disabled then this option will be 
            ignored.

            There are several situations where the embedded window will 
            be destroyed and later recreated by invoking the script 
            mentioned above.  For example, when changing the value of 
            some of the tablelist widget or column configuration 
            options, sorting the items, or moving a row or a column,
            the widget"s contents will be redisplayed, which makes it 
            necessary to recreate the embedded windows.  This operation
            won"t preserve the changes made on the embedded windows 
            after their creation.  For this reason, you should avoid 
            any changes on embedded windows outside their creation 
            scripts.

        The -background, -font, -foreground, -selectbackground, and 
        -selectforeground cell configuration options override the 
        options with the same names set at row, column, or widget level
        if the specified value is not an empty string.  

        See the COLORS AND FONTS section for further details on these options.
