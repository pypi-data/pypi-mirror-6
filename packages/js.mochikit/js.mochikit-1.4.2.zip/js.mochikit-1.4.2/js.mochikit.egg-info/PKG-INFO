        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `MochiKit`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org/
        .. _`MochiKit`: http://mochikit.org/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.mochikit``) are published to some URL.
        
        You can either depend on ``js.mochikit.mochikit`` to get all of MochiKit, or
        pick individual modules like ``js.mochikit.Sortable``.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``mochikit`` from ``js.mochikit`` and
        ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.mochikit import mochikit
          >>> mochikit.need()
