        Introduction
        ============
        
        Logtail allows you to view logfiles for your django project via your django
        admin, and will also provide you with a live tail of the logfiles using ajax
        polling - and therefore without the need for a long-running django process.
        
        Django 1.4+ compatible.
        
        See Also: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_logtail
        
        Installation and Use
        ====================
        
        Django logtail takes a dictionary from your settings.py as follows::
        
            LOGTAIL_FILES = {
                'apache': '/var/www/www.foo.com.log',
                'django': '/var/log/www.foo.com/project.log',
            }
        
        Add it via your installed apps::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'django_logtail',
            )
        
        
        Then absolutely ensure that the user that your django process runs as (whether
        it's via wsgi, fastcgi, django runserver for debugging, or something else) has
        permission to read all of the files in your LOGTAIL_FILES list.
        
        logtail should then appear in your admin, and provide access to these files -
        including a live tail of the file. Note that files will not appear if the
        django process cannot access them.
        
        Other Settings
        ==============
        
        You can set the default update interval for the log tailing::
        
            LOGTAIL_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 50000 # Default is 3000 (three second)
        
        Developing
        ==========
        
        You can build a development environment using the following instructions::
        
            virtualenv venv --distribute
            source venv/bin/activate
            pip install -e .
            python manage.py syncdb
            python manage.py runserver
        
        Logtail ``dumpdata`` Issue
        ==========================
        
        If you use ``python manage.py dumpdata``, be sure to add the
        ``--exclude=logtail`` flag to your command or you'll be presented with a::
        
            CommandError: Unable to serialize database: relation "django_logtail_log" does not exist
            LINE 1: SELECT "django_logtail_log"."id" FROM "django_logtail_log" O...
        
        traceback when you run the dumpdata command. This is because django_logtail
        needs to pretend that it has a model called ``Log`` when registering with the
        django admin site (``ModelAdmin`` objects can't exist without being bound to a
        ``Model``).
        
        ``syncdb`` will still work however, because the pretend model is marked as
        ``managed = False``.

        ------------------
        
        - Adding ``django_logtail.urls`` to your project's ``ROOT_URLCONF`` is no

        - Now that the view is served from the ModelAdmin, use the Media class to define
          jquery dependency, and use django's built-in jquery object rather than using a
          CDN.
        - Added example/ project for easier testing.
        - Update documentation.
