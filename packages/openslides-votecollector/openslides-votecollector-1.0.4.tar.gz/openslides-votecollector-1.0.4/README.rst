 VoteCollector Plugin for OpenSlides
=====================================


Overview

The VoteCollector plugin for OpenSlides was contracted by the German
company Voteworks. It was initially developed by the core authors of
OpenSlides, Oskar Hahn and Emanuel Sch√ºtze (`Intevation GmbH <http://www.intevation.de/>`_), in April 2012.
