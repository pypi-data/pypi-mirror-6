        Advanced search and discovery tool
        ==================================
        
        This tool was built to allow you to query the worlds largest database. The
        query strings will be rendered in your local web browser as standard HTML
        content. At this time this tool is not compatible with most Server Operating
        Systems as they are generally headless and the tool does require access to a
        local web browser.
        
        Why
        ---
        
        Sometimes you just need a tool that will allow you to search for things that
        may be of interest and what better way to search the world for information than
        to do it via the CLI.  This tool will assist you in finding the information
        you need to do your job, development, or research and it will do it rapidly.
        
        Example Usage
        -------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            asd linux --query how does it work
