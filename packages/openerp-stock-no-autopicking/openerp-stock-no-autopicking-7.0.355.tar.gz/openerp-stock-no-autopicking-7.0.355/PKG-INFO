Description: 
        
        This module allows an intermediate picking process to provide raw materials to production orders.
        =================================================================================================
        
        One example of usage of this module is to manage production made by your
        suppliers (sub-contracting). To achieve this, set the assembled product which is
        sub-contracted to 'No Auto-Picking' and put the location of the supplier in the
        routing of the assembly operation.
