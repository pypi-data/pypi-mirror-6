0.3 (2014-02-09)
----------------

Documentation review and development environment refactoring: let's try to
simplify usage and development of `hospital`.

- Feature #25: the Makefile in project's repository no longer creates a
  virtualenv. Developers setup the environment as they like, i.e. using
  virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper or whatever. Added documentation about the
  Makefile scope and usage.

- Feature #19: reviewed contributor guide, added branching policy.

- Feature #24: added note about project's status in documentation.

- Feature #21: reviewed API documentation.

- Bugfix #18: README can be rendered as HTML with `docutils`' ``rst2html.py``.
  Fixes PyPI information page.
