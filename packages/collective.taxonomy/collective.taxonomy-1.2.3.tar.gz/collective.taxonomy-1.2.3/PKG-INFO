Description: This add-on provides support for hierarchical taxonomies in multiple
        languages, letting users easily associate existing content with terms
        from one or more taxonomies.
        
            `Taxonomy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy>`_ is the
            "discipline of defining groups [...] on the basis of shared
            characteristics and giving names to those groups. Each group is
            given a rank and groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form
            a super group of higher rank and thus create a hierarchical
            classification".
        
        Here's an example of the "taxonomic kingdoms of life"::
        
            Living Organisms
            Living Organisms -> Eukaryotic
            Living Organisms -> Eukaryotic -> Simple multicells or unicells
            Living Organisms -> Eukaryotic -> Multicellular
            Living Organisms -> Eukaryotic -> Multicellular -> Autotrophic
            Living Organisms -> Eukaryotic -> Multicellular -> ...
            Living Organisms -> Prokaryotic
            Living Organisms -> Prokaryotic -> Archaebacteria
            Living Organisms -> Prokaryotic -> Eubacteria
            Living Organisms -> Prokaryotic -> Eubacteria -> ...
        
        Taxonomies can be quite large, sometimes in the tens of thousands
        (10,000+). And in sites with multiple languages, each title – or
        *caption* – must appear in translation.
        
        Note that the selection of a term in the hierarchy implies the
        selection of all its parents. In the example above this means that if
        "Eubacteria" is selected, then also "Prokaryotic" and "Living
        Organisms" will be.
        
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        The implementation tries to meet the following requirements:
        
        #. Support many (10,000+) terms.
        
        #. Terms can be organized in a hierarchical classification.
        
        #. Easily import and export in a common format (VDEX).
        
        #. Taxonomies will provide vocabularies that are translateable.
        
        #. Use behaviors to provide a choice field for each taxonomy.
        
        #. Manage taxonomies and assign to content types "through-the-web".
        
        In the description below, we touch on each of these requirements.
        
        
        Data structure
        --------------
        
        In order to limit both the memory and computation requirements, the
        term data is contained in exactly one persistent index per language, a
        mapping from the *materialized term path* to its *term identifier*.
        
        The term::
        
            Living Organisms -> Eukaryotic -> Simple multicells or unicells
        
        will be indexed under this path::
        
            "Living Organisms/Eukaryotic/Simple multicells or unicells"
        
        The index allows us to provide an iterator over the sorted vocabulary
        terms, virtually without cost (as well as containment queries).
        
        At the same time, while the hierarchy is encoded, we can quickly look
        up terms in a subtree.
        
        
        Data exchange
        -------------
        
        While ``collective.taxonomy`` (this package) does make it possible to
        create, manage and edit taxonomies from a browser-based interface, the
        primary focus is to support the exchange of terms in the VDEX format:
        
            The `IMS Vocabulary Definition Exchange
            <http://www.imsglobal.org/vdex/>`_ (VDEX) specification defines a
            grammar for the exchange of value lists of various classes:
            collections often denoted "vocabulary".
        
        This exchange is integrated with `GenericSetup
        <http://packages.python.org/Products.GenericSetup/>`_ which manages
        imports and exports using setup profiles. It is also possible to
        use the controlpanel for importing and exporting VDEX files.
        
        The package comes with integration for the `Dexterity
        <http://plone.org/products/dexterity/>`_ content type framework: for
        each taxonomy, a *behavior* is available that adds a choice field
        which pulls its vocabulary from the taxonomy. The behavior is
        configurable in terms of field name, title and whether it allows the
        selection of one or more multiple terms.  You should *first* install
        dexterity and then ``collective.taxonomy``, otherwise the behaviors
        for the existing taxonomies will be missing.
        
        
        How does it work?
        -----------------
        
        The main objective during this project has been to get a high rate
        of through-the-Web administration. Therefore the use of the product
        will not require any Python programming nor configure.zcml directives.
        
        In the controlpanel (``/@@taxonomy-settings``), the user can:
        
        #. Import taxonomies from VDEX files.
        
        #. Export taxonomies existing to VDEX files.
        
        #. Delete taxonomies
        
        #. Add and delete behaviours for taxonomies
        
        When a new behavior is created for a taxonomy, it can easily be added
        to the desired content types using the content type control panel, provided
        by Dexterity. After this is done, the taxonomy is available on add and edit
        forms, and it is also available for collections, if ``plone.app.collection``
        is used on the site. An index is also created, so the taxonomies can easily
        be used for catalog queries.
        
        See a short guide on how to use the product `here <http://bo.geekworld.dk/introducing-collective-taxonomy/>`_.
        
        Requirements
        ============

        How can I import an existing ``ATVocabularyManager`` vocabulary?
        
          Use the script provided in this `gist <https://gist.github.com/3826155>`_. Just
          remember to edit the vocabIdentifier and vocabName.
        
        To-Do
        =====
        
        - Implement drag'n'drop for editing taxonomies.
        
        - Support multiple languages when editing taxonomies.
        
        - Better documentation.

        Existing work
        =============
        
        In 2010, Rok Garbas <rok@garbas.si> reimplemented and extended prior
        work by `Seantis <http://www.seantis.ch/>`_ and released
        `collective.vdexvocabulary
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.vdexvocabulary>`_. This
        package allows you to configure and populate vocabulary components
        from a VDEX-specification. The package supports flat vocabularies
        only, and support for multiple languages takes a different approach
        (vocabularies are returned in an already translated form). Note that
        vocabularies are loaded in a read-only mode, although it's been
        proposed that vocabularies might be edited through-the-web.
        
        In 2005, Jens Klein <jens.klein@bluedynamics.com> released
        `ATVocabularyManager
        <http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager>`_. This package makes
        it possible to create taxonomies using Plone's content management
        interface with terms existing as regular site content. It's integrated
        with the `Archetypes <http://plone.org/products/archetypes>`_ content
        type framework (now deprecated).
        
        
        .. [#] Term relationships are currently not supported.
