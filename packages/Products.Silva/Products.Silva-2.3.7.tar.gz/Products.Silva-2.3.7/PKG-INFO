        Silva
        =====
        
        `Silva`_ is a Zope-based web application designed for the creation and
        management of structured, textual content. Silva allows users to enter
        new documents as well as edit existing documents using a web
        interface.
        
        Silva stores the content in a structured format (XML), and keeps a
        strict separation between the way the content is used and the way it
        is presented. This leads to several important advantages:
        
        * The same content can be used in different media, such as the web,
          paper, or word processor content. Web publication of content is
          native to Silva as it is based on Zope, but Silva also has export
          filters to PDF and MS Word, and more can be built when the demand
          arises. Note: these export filters are not included in this
          release. They will be released as separate applications (Docma).
        
        * The content is future proofed and not out of date as soon as you
          want to use a new system or present it in a different way.
        
        * The structuring of the content facilitates more sophisticated
          searching and indexing.
        
        Silva supports (but does not require) a separation between authors who
        can create new content and editors who can approve whether content
        actually gets published. It also allows delegation of editing or
        authoring responsibilities of a section of the publication to
        others. Thus, users can be empowered (avoiding a single-person
        bottleneck), without the loss of editorial control.
        
        To assist in the publication process, Silva implements workflow where
        multiple versions of the same document are kept around at the same
        time. One version of a particular document may be published while
        another version can be edited at the same time.
        
        Silva is extensible with new document types and other types of content
        objects.

        Changes
        =======
        
        Silva 2.3.7 (2012/05/10)
        ------------------------
        
        - Various Kupu fixes for IE 7, 9 and 10, and webkit based browsers.
        
        Silva 2.3.6 (2012/02/23)
        ------------------------
        
        - Improve tools support in Kupu to support more complex widget (used
          in Silva news).
        
        - Improve mimetype support for Files, and extension computation. Don't
          rely on Python standard library, as they have faulty defaults. Make
          possible to provide a mime.types and a magic file in order to have
          correct computation on system that provides funky defaults.
        
        - Improve File converter to be more efficiant: you don't need to
          create a file with the Silva File content, if the Silva File content
          is already in a file on the file system.
        
        - Compressed Silva File should not be editable even if they are text.
        
        - Don't loose references and metadata while converting Silva File
          storage.
        
        - Fixed type in the code for the service_messages zmi screen, so that
          enabling the service will actually enable the service.  IF you use
          the message service in Silva 2.3 (for emailing publication messages),
          you need to go back into the zmi screen and re-enable.  The screen
          showed it was enabled, but in reality it was not.
        
        Silva 2.3.4 (2011/10/04)
        ------------------------
        
        - Port a faster implementation for the sidebar service based on the
          Zope catalog.

          identifier.
        
        - Add support for file encoding (gzip, bzip2) to files (this is not
          charset !).
        
        - Improve Kupu Silva tools (Link and specially Image tool). Don't show
          the update button if you can't update / nothing changed in the Image
          tool.
        
        - Use the new member service API MemberLookupError to report error in
          the UI while searching for users.
        
        - Add a compatibility fix for Zope 2.12 and old stored template in the
          ZODB.
        
        - Fix installation of the legacy layout.

          content use the current content.
        
        - The reference lookup widget have been improved to be able to propose
          the user to add content. For this a new REST API permitting to list
          addable in a container have been added.
        
        - The HTML code of the SMI have been improved to be more easily
          skinable using only CSS (remove hardcoded style for instance).

        Silva 2.3b2 (2010/10/27)
        ------------------------
        
        - Members folder is now a BTreeFolder, that improve performance on sites
          with lot of users. service_members is now an utility.
        
        - Issues with PIL usages and libmagic have been fixed to work properly
          on native Windows.
        
        - tab access has been reimplemented in ``silva.core.smi``. The request role
          feature has been dropped. The API to add/remove member access has
          been completely revised.
        
        - Groups support has been removed in favor of the ``silva.pas.base``
          implementation.
        
        - Import/Export of broken references via Silva XML is now possible.
        
        - The subscription feature moved to a different package

        - Publication actions (Approve, Reject, Withdraw, Publish) now trigger
          Zope events.
        
        - Kupu properties tool has been rebuilt using a REST Zeam Form with
          the help of ``zeam.form.silva``. It is now much easier to integrate a
          regular edit form inside Kupu.
        
        - User settings (change name / email address) have been rebuilt using a
          REST form with the help of ``zeam.form.silva``.
        
        - More tests have been improved and modernized, specially functional
          tests, using ``infrae.testbrowser``. SilvaBrowser has been removed.
        
        - More views got modernized into Zope views.
        
        - General usability on refactored screens has been improved
          (description, access keys, translations).
        
        
        Silva 2.3b1 (2010/07/16)
        ------------------------
        
        - Users can select a Gravatar image to appear next to their name in Silva.
        
        - Silva File and Images have been reviewed, HEAD and HTTP headers are now
          properly implemented. ExtFile storage is considered legacy, please migrate
          to Blob storage.
        
        - References are used to link content: Link, Indexer, Ghosts and links, images
          in Kupu uses it to refer linked content. XML import / export have been updated
          to work with thoses.
        
        - z3c.forms have been replaced with Zeam Forms.
        
        - Silva now uses Python 2.6 and Zope 2.12.
        
        - Most of Silva contents now properly triggers Zope event when being
          added/edited.
        
        - More parts of the SMI have been replaced by Zope views and forms.
        
        - Tests now use infrae.testing. Functional tests rely on infrae.wsgi.
        
        Silva 2.2 (2010-03-31)
        ----------------------
        
        - A simple PhotoGallery demo view have been added to use on any
          container.
        
        - Silva Links now support again relative links.
        
        - SilvaExternalSources is installed by default, and the toc element in
          the default created SilvaDocument have been removed.
        
        - Deprecate Products.Silva.helpers.makeContainerFilter and makeZMIFilter
          (makeZMIFilter was moved to silva.core.conf.utils).  Fix signature checking
          in Folder.filtered_meta_types.
        
        - kupu: the `link` input field in the link toolbox was changed to be a
          textarea.  In 2.2 releases prior to 2.2 final, the input field changed
          to a textarea on focus and back to an input field onblur, so long urls
          where easier to view.  This caused confusing 'double clicking' behavior
          in order to manually add or update a link (first to unfocus, second to update)
        
        - The formulator lookupwindow field changed to a textarea to address the same
          concerns as the link toolbox in kupu mentioned above.
        
        Silva 2.2b1 (2010-02-01)
        ------------------------
        
        New Features
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - External Sources are now previewable in kupu.  When an external
          source with preview enabled is added to a document, the rendered
          extneral source is shown in kupu.  When that external source is
          active, or when hovering over it with the mouse, the external source
          will have a different background color, a border, and a 'lock' icon.
          This shows the extent of the external source within the document and
          also provides a hint that it is not editable.
        
        - The reference lookup window formulator widget now supports multiple
          entries with javascript to add / remove entries.  NOTE: the default
          is to retain the old behavior (supporting one reference, for either
          type of lookup field).  If an exsiting lookup window field is
          changed to support more the onclick widget property needs to change.
          Copy the default value from a new lookupwindowfield.
        
        - DateTime widgets in the SMI now have a 'calendar' button which
          opens a popup calendar -- an easier way to supply datetimes.
        
        - fixed formulator lookupwindow widget to support functioning in multi-reference
          mode in a metadata set.
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - uncommon (but valid) characters were not supported in the LHS
          (mailbox) side of email addresses in mailto: links in Silva objects
          using silvaxml content storage.  An example of an email address that
          did not work: firstname.o'surname@beds.ac.uk .  The link regexp was
          expanded to allow the full range of characters in the mailbox as
          specified in RFC 2822#3.4.1.
        
        - In kupu, when an active external source (i.e. the external source tool is
          showing that ES's parameters), clicking on the same ES no longer causes
          the tool to reload (no more flicker)
        
        - Errors when attempting to upload interlaced PNGs are now caught and
          displayed to the user.
        
        - launchpad #400019: Silva Link: allow editing of relative / absolute
          property, or get rid of it altogether.  Silva 2.1 allowed editing of
          this property.  Silva 2.2 has removed the link type.  Now there is
          only one type of link, and it is the authors responsibility to
          ensure it is a valid relative or absolute link.
        
        - For a possible security issue the "served by host foo" comment was removed
          from macro_index.pt
        
        - The user clipboard 'remove user' button now returns to the correct add user
          form. (search or direct user lookup)
        
        - tab_preview frameset now requires that the user be logged in.  Previously, if
          using form-based auth, one might see an authentication screen in both
          frames.
        
        - update last author when documents are saved.
        
        - IContent objects (well, those extending Products.Silva.Content.Content) are now
          cataloged.
        
        - enable changing the html form enctype of edit views using one of the
          macro_edit macros
        
        - #261571: AutoTOCs have a new property "show container link". When set to 'yes'
          the public view will include an <h3> above the table of contents with
          the title of the container of the AutoTOC linking to the container.  This is
          useful if the AutoTOC is a sitemap.
        
        Ported from Silva 2.1
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - unpublished Versions of VersionedContent objects were not unindexed from
          the catalog when the Version was removed (e.g. via the status tab).
          A subscriber was added for the IObjectWillBeRemoved event
        
        - fixed helpers.SwitchClass (used by the folder <--> publication conversion)
          so that the ObjectManager api's are used to set the new object, keeping
          the metadata structures up to date
        
        Silva 2.2a2 (2009-01-12)
        ------------------------
        
        New Features
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Recursive publishing actions: on the publish tab it is now possible
          to select containers.  If a folder is selected (which is transparent)
          all subobjects are also selected.  Publication types may also be selected.
          All publishing actions will now be applied to all items contained in the
          selected containers, and recursively all items within publications.
        
        - A New "Kupu Popup" formulator field.  This field is for html content
          and pops up a "popup kupu" to provide easy wysiwyg editing.
        
        - Redesigned link and image tools: the link and image reference fields
          now have an icon button for the 'get reference' functionality -- saving
          toolbox space -- and when a reference is present an 'edit linked reference'
          button.  When clicked for a valid silva reference, this opens up a new window
          to the edit tab of the reference.
        
        - The link tool's input field converts to a text area when it has the focus
          to allow for easier editing of long link references.
        
        - External Source Tool: the select external source drop-down
          now has "Select Item" as the first option, rather than the
          ES at the top of the list.  This cleans up the interface a bit.
        
        - 101103: allowed addables functionality is now moved to Silva
          Folders.  Any IContainer extending Products.Silva.Folder can
          now have addables settings.  NOTE: the allowed_addables API
          has also changed
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed Internet Explorer 7 kupu issue triggered when clicking the
          unordered list button.
        
        - External Source Tool: the title now reverts back to "external
          source" when the tool is reset
        
        - External Source Tool: removing an external source (via the
          remove button) now resets the tool
        
        - Added condition in Container/tab_edit for objects that are both
          containers and content to show only one author name.
        
        Ported from Silva 2.1
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed issues with unicode characters in href value of links in
          Silva Documents.
        
        - Fixed some formatting issues with buttons in the tab editor for
          containers.
        
        - Fixed 310589: Silva AutoTOC ignores "types to list" setting
          when using silva sort order.
        
        
        - Add a function sendmail which can send mail using Mailhost and
          Maildrophost in Zope 2.11 (otherwise Maildrophost is broken in Zope
          2.11).
        
        - Display icons of members in tab_access, the user lookup screen, and
          group edition.
        
        Silva 2.2a1 (2008-11-18)
        ------------------------
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - 261569: the new toc features made available in 2.1 are now
          accessible within documents by using the TOC code source (id:

          like in Grok. You can use resourceinclude after to include them
          directly in your skin.
        
        - Installation of extension have been reviewed, now you can use a
          default installer to install an extension which just add few content
          types. You can after extend this installer.
        
        - Grok is used to configure Silva content types, services, views skins
          and forms.
        
        - ExtensionRegistry have been re-implemented to support egg
          extension. Metadata about these extensions are fetch from egg
          metadata.
        
        - Upgrade steps support now every complex revision number types
          (2.2.4b1-dev34 for instance).
        
        - We (again) needed to be able to have objects other than publishable
          content and assets, and so we finally decided to not force
          everything to be an asset, but to create a new interface
          INonPublishable (from which IAsset inherits) so we can get all of
          the silva objects that are not publishable content with one method
          that is not get_assets. get_assets remains, but should now only be
          used to get all the assets (i.e. files, images, etc.) in a
          folder. To get everything that is not a publishable use
          get_non_publishables instead.
        
        Features ported from 2.1 branch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - User types can select which roles they are allowed to be attributed
          to.
        
        - Users can to *localized* and only be defined for a sub-container.
        
        - Middleground macro have been re-factored to a view, with actions on
          it as viewlets. Extensions can plug sub-screen on any tab now,
          without overriding any tab screen.
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - fixed 274668: multiple query parameters on relative links broke,
          because the ampersands were not properly escaped.
        
        - fixed 100856: add support in Bindings for rendering the edit views
          of elements with values from the request
        
        - Fixed 101827: lookup window was always displaying the new 'place
          reference to container...' button, even when containers
          (specifically the container's meta type) wasn't in the filter list
          for the lookup window
        
        - Fix for kupu in html transform from
          lis.append(silva.li(el.convert(context))) to
          lis.append(silva.li(silva.br(), el.convert(context)))
        
        - Fix for list items nesting problem
        
        Bugfixes ported from 2.1 branch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Silva Documents with code sources no longer lose the parameter types
          of the codes source parameters on xmlexport.
        
        - Make sure that pressing the tab key when inside the kupu editor will
          always perform the indent/outdent editor commands.  This was not
          working anymore on Firefox3)
        
        - Rebuilding the catalog sometimes ran out of memory, since it was
          done in one huge transaction. Added a generator to lazily get
          objects to reindex, and then commit after every 500 objects. The
          exact number might need tweaking. (I suspect 500 is on the
          conservative side.)
        
        - html in parameters of external sources is no longer double escaped
          on saving.
        
        - fixed 263503: adding support for relative links with query
          parameters (e.g. /path/to/object?key=value)
        
        - correct unauthorized error when a chief editor/manager want to use
          the access tab and he don't have any access in the Silva root and
          the service members implements the use direct lookup protocol.
        
        - fixed a bug in tab_edit.pt where a dynamic string was being i18n-ed.
        
        Ported from 2.0 branch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed return_url when adding content from the lookup window.
        
        - added logging to catalog rebuilds, because they can potentially take
          a very long time.
        
        - fixed a bug on tab_access.pt where a tal: was missing
        
        - added logging to catalog rebuilds, because they can potentially take
          a very long time.
        
        
        Silva 2.1
        ---------
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - A quota subsystem has been added. It lets Managers set a quota on a
          publication (which can also be a virtual host root). Containers
          within the publication acquire the quota. The quota does not tally
          the space used by the xml of documents but counts only assets. The
          used space is tracked on every container and displayed on the
          settings screen. The quota can only be set by a Manager in the
          settings screen of the publication. The quota subsystem is off by
          default and must be activated in 'service_extensions',
        
        - 209497: Silva Link edit tab now displays rendered http link, while
          the preview shows the redirect within the frameset.
        
        - 100974: the preview tab in the SMI now previews using the public
          layout, with the SMI tabs still at the top.  NOTE: TOC elements in
          documents used to link to each items '/edit/tab_preview' when the
          document was viewed via it's preview tab.  This was creating issues,
          so now links in TOC elements always link to the public version.
        
        - 101827: A) lookup window will now list containers for any type of
          lookup window.  You can click the container title to "drill down"
          into the container, rather than (or in addition to) clicking the
          container's title in the sidebar.  In the cases where previously
          containers weren't listed, the containers are now listed, but
          references cannot be placed to them.  B) a "place reference to this
          container..." button was added, so you don't have to use the sidebar
          to navigate up one level C) Immediately when the radio button is
          selected, the reference is placed and the window is closed
        
        - Made 'keywords' metadata field an 'index field' by default
        
        - Use lxml instead of libxml2/libxslt for XSLT rendering. xslt
          stylesheets in extensions can import doc_elements.xslt by
          using::
        
            <xsl:import href="silvabase:doc_elements.xslt"/>
        
          A custom lxml filename resolver will find the actual file.
        
          Note: check encoding of output.
        
        - Refactoring functional tests, built SilvaBrowser API for basic
          Silva functional tests.
        
        - Took out automatic install of SilvaFind when making a new
          Silva root.  Instead a new option is added in the SilvaRoot
          addform to create a Search instance.
        
        - The css for form button controls has been refactored. There is
          now a standard class, 'button', which can be modified by
          adding a second class name, the action type which the button
          performs. These actions are: manipulator, transporter,
          executor, remover, and canceler. E.g.  class="button
          transporter".
        
        - Since the full media export is restricted to Chief Editors and
          up, there's no reason to show the import or export buttons to
          lower level roles (since the pure xml import/export is
          deprecated).  Conditioned the buttons.
        
        - Modernized buttons and matrix nav based on trainee
          feedback. Use a float for button alignment classes or obviate
          the spaces in html.
        
        - Renovated the Kupu image toolbox to make it more userfriendly.
          Improved the alignments in the table toolbox.
        
        - New "Editor Comments" Kupu Tool: displays the "internal comments"
          silva-extra metadata field if there are comments. This promotes the
          visibility of internal / editor comments so that anyone editing the
          document will see them. This tool is only visible if there are
          comments, and does not allow editing at this time.  This toolbox is
          non-collapsible, and requires a version of kupu newer than 1.4b1 to
          support non-collapsible toolboxes.
        
        - Support for direct username assignment to clipboard. If the
          service_members service defines a method 'direct_user_lookup' that
          returns True, the user lookup UI in the access tab is changed to an
          add user to clipboard UI. This allows the adding of new users to a
          clipboard directly.
        
        - bug 100741: when groups are to be used, the groups management screen
          also shows groups defined elsewhere (not just local to the
          container) and provides links to edit those groups.
        
        - 100750: "Insert new object here" functionality.  When you select an
          object in a containers edit list, then select the new object to add
          from the "add new content drop-down", the new object will be placed
          at the location of the selected object in the edit list.
        
        - 100765 caching issues with /globals: All files in /globals are now
          tied to an Accelerated HTTP Cache Manager at
          <silva_root>/service_static_cache_manager.  This cache manager sets
          the appropriate HTTP headers to enable browsers to cache these
          objects.  The default setting is to cache for one week, and since
          the content is static, also cache non-anonymous requests.  The Silva
          root needs to be refreshed in order to take advantage of this cache
          manager.  Refreshing happens automatically during Silva upgrades.
        
        - 101351 Extension registration now allows multuple extensions in the
          depends_on argument (in the form of tuples).  The zcml
          silva:extension depends_on directive, if present, now requires
          tuples.  Additionally the extensions service now displays the
          dependencies for each extension and displays a warning next to each
          dependency that is not available.
        
        - Significant performance improvement in converting folders to
          publications and vice-versa
        
        - #162545 Containers should retain the last author information
          Container author information is now displayed in the parent
          container's contents tab in the "author" column, rather than "n/a".
          Container last author and last modified dates are updated when
          objects are moved, deleted, added, pasted into the container, when
          the container's metadata is modified (properties tab and settings
          sub-tab), and when the container is converted to/from a
          publication/folder.
        
        - developers: issue 100712: tab_edit infrastructure has been
          refactoring so that each content has a tab_edit.pt rather than the
          'edit.pt/.py' method.  The 'edit.pt/.py' method has been deprecated
          so that extensions may use this release to transition.  FMI see
          doc/developer_notes.txt
        
        - changed the External Source kupu tool title when editing a source in
          a document so it now says "es <<source title>>" and the source id is
          displayed on hover.  External Sources in documents now display the
          title inside the "<< >>" and the id when hovered over.  The
          description of the external source is also included in the kupu
          content.
        
        - The kupu content no longer displays the keys and values of external
          source parameters.
        
        - AutoTOCs are now more configurable, with the following new
          features:
        
          1. choose Silva types that AutoTOCs will list (any Silva type,
             including Assets!)
        
          2. changeable depth
        
          3. optionally display the silva-extra content_description of content
        
          4. optionally show the icon of each content type
        
          5. Specify sort order: alphabetical, reverse-alpha, and silva SMI
             order
        
        - 100670: The ZMI add list has been uncluttered. Silva content types
          that should only be created through the SMI are no longer addable in
          the ZMI. Also, content types that only make sense within a Silva
          Root aren't addable outside one. Developers: see
          doc/developer_changes.txt for further information on how your Silva
          extensions can take advantage of this.
        
        Features ported from 2.0 branch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - added support for 'elaborate' code sources, that show their add/edit
          form in a pop-up instead of in the kupu toolbox. Useful when code
          sources have a large number of variables.
        
        - 128518 Import of non existing values for (multi)list metadata values
          gave a formulator SelectionValidator error.
        
        - Made Silva work with ExtFile once again: we no longer configure the
          filesystem_path in the service_files, but leave it to the
          extfile.ini.
        
        - additional behaviour to mangle.Id.new(), when passing True as the
          first argument one can suppress the ValueError raised on invalid ids
          (and always have a new id generated)
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Took out the sec_clean_roles method in Security.py: it was
          used nowhere, and it broke with anything other than standard
          zope acl_users, because it called the non API
          get_valid_userids.
        
        - Fixed mimetype checking in SilvaDocument to make kupu editing
          work in Firefox 3
        
        - ie 6 compatibilite fix so smi is readable in this non
          standards compliant browser.
        
        - 238341: frontend.css.dtml is css valid now.
        
        - When SMTP errors occur while sending notification, we log
          them, but no longer hold up the publication/approval process.
        
        - When pdf/word conversion results in errors, the converted text
          is indexed anyway, if there is any.
        
        - fixed attribute error in kupu editor of changed images
        
        - 101376: adding content with the same name as catalog indexes
          can cause problems and break the content.  The catalog index
          ids are now reserved ids.
        
        - 101780: worked around a ZCatalog bug which causes
          containers to be unindexed twice when a parent
          container is removed.
        
        - 101464: can't place headings inside list items in kupu
        
        - 101228: remove slide links from object lookup window, so that the
          full SMI cannot be loaded within it
        
        - Set overflow of selects in Kupu toolboxes to hidden, preventing long
          titles from pushing the toolbox wider.
        
        - Changed the threshold variable in upgrade.py from 500 to 50, this
          may impact speed of upgrades negatively but it seems necessary for
          for instance ExtFile migration, where 500 objects can become too
          large for a single commit.
        
        - Setting the i18n domain for kupu htmlmacros.html to silva so toolbox
          is translated again bug 101706.
        
        - Changed the new version button in the editor screen from an input to
          a button, to avoid css conflicts with frontend.css controls styles
        
        - fixed 156921: Escaping image title strings.
        
        - fixed 101240: SilvaExternalSource cannot be disabled.
        
        - fixed 100835: image upload screen should show allowed formats
        
        - fixed 101174: When an id is in use on the Zope level, inform users
          accordingly
        
        - Added True switch to Image.py tag method to escape double quotes.
        
        - Changed the 'priority' attribute of the silva:content zcml attribute
          to a float, to support more granular priorities (they way it was
          prior to Silva 2.0 zcml)
        
        - xslt renderer: fixed an extra whitespace issue that occurred when an
          image as linked, by setting indent="no" in normal_view.xslt
        
        - fixed 101791: problem with Link object as index of a container
        
        - fixed 101514: Empty list elements in Kupu.  When you press tab
          twice, Kupu inserts an element in the "missed out" level
          automatically.  This empty list element appears as a bullet that
          can't be clicked on.  Now, the 'intermediate' empty list is now
          stripped out when saving.
        
        - fixed 101411: Compilation of an XSLT stylesheet fails if an imported
          stylesheet imports another stylesheet.  A string interpolation
          method was used to insert the path to imported stylesheets.  This
          method is no longer used, and relative paths can be used instead.
          E.g. to override noramal_view.xslt from your product's
          'transform/renderer/myrender.xslt', you can do: <xsl:import
          href="../../Silva/transform/renderer/normal_view.xslt" />
        
        - fixed 101253: Pasted ghosts have unknown author when you click
          "paste to ghost", the resultant ghost object now has author info
        
        - fixed 101554: Ghost Version item in service_catalog is not updated
          after haunted has been modified (example 2) When documents are
          updated, all ghosts referencing them are also reindexed.
        
        - fixed 101064: revert to previous focus box in Content Publish screen
          remains available after reverting. The revert_to_previous
          functionality has been removed from Silva, since it was obsoleted by
          "manage versions"
        
        Bugfixes ported from 2.0 branch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Formulator lines fields no longer break when values have
          quotes or unicode characters in them.
        
        - Message feedback from the pdf/word to text converters is once
          again presented to the user. (Was inadvertently lost in the
          Z2.10 merge)
        
        - The id of a Silva Object is no longer in its indexed fulltext,
          as that makes no sense.
        
        - The word and pdf to text converters no longer include error
          messages in the returned converted text.
        
        - object_lookup.py had a missing variable definition 'addables'
          for some code paths. Added this again.
        
        - In the reference lookup, nothing is stored in the SESSION
          anymore, preventing weird heisenbugs.
        
        - 185422: Javascript prompt to save changes in kupu when
          leaving the editor wasn't working
        
        - silva_lookup_referer is stored in the session. If for some
          reason the session gets lost, that no longer results in an
          error.
        
        - lookup_search conditionally converts username to unicode. The
          name could come from a form, or from code, we don't know
          which, so we have to code defensively. :(
        
        - KeyError in tab_status_export fixed
        
        - Links to local (i.e. not fully qualified) domain names are no
          longer incorrectly converted to relative urls in rendered
          SilvaDocuments.
        
        - Special characters in titles are escaped in the tocrenderer
          adapter, to play nice with xslt rendering.
        
        - Fixed the factory function calls for File and Image, which
          still were still called with the spurious 'title' arguments on
          some code paths.
        
        - fixed WuW144: Images were not always shown correctly in kupu
          when resized.
        
        - fixed 158381: Group objects should be removable even if the
          groups service isn't installed.
        
        - fixed 158384: can't add groups: title error issue
        
        - fixed 157010: anchors in links: # -> %23
        
        - fixed wuw144: Incorrect caching of images.
                        (was reverted in silva-2.0.3b1)
        
        - fixed 150809: sidebar cache not invalidated when folder
          removed
        
        - Adding Groups, Virtual Groups and IPGroups was broken.
        
        - creationdate is once again set on versioned content.
        
        - The lookup window allowed one to add content and assets to
          ghostfolders, which isn't really advisable. This is no longer
          possible.
        
        - Fixed the thumbnailing/caching bug. When a thumbnailed image was
          resized back to 100%, a copy was being made to make sure the
          modification date headers are newer. I changed this so only the
          modifcation date is updated, but no copy of the image is being made,
          instead the original image is used.
        
        - Removed extra <br/> tag when viewing codesources in kupu.
        
        - fix for bug 109008: wrong tooltip when hovering over version status
          link
        
        - importing a zexp file with the Silva root in there was failing,
          because a Zope 3 event got fired that tried to re-add 'collection'
          to 'service_metadata' while this is already there. Added a check to
          SilvaMetadata (1.0.1) that fixes this.
        
        - fix for bug: 101651: default settings for columns / rows on table
          creation in kupu
        
        - widget-based and xslt renderers render underlines in the same
          way with <span class="underline">
        
        - fixed 101494: Empty "source" elements break the XSLT renderer
        
        - fixed 101396: paragraphs in lists, tables rendered differently in
          widgets vs xslt renderers
        
        - fixed 101567: hires image links work from kupu but not widgets
          renderers
        
        - fixed 148863: toc rendering not XHTML compliant
        
        - Security.sec_get_all_roles_for_userid(userid) was broken in that it
          ignored the argument. Changed it to Security.sec_get_all_roles() and
          all calls to it, which were passing in the current userid anyway.
        
        - fixed "excessive recursion" error when users click 'new version' to
          make a new copy of a silva document to edit then click the browser's
          back button and click 'new version' again.
        
        - adjusted the description in the add form of links, since that
          incorrectly indicated that absolute links would be checked.
        
        - on rare occasions, the external source tool in kupu wouldn't work
          for specific documents (double-unquoting the docref)
        
        - Ghosts and Ghostfolders no longer show editable titles in the rename
          screen.
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - additional behaviour to mangle.Id.new(), when passing True as the
          first argument one can suppress the ValueError raised on invalid ids
          (and always have a new id generated)
        
        Ported from 1.6 branch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Reversal of fix for issue
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/silva/+bug/101791 "Problem with Link
          object" since the issue was fixed in Zope 2.8+ itself, and then the
          bugfix turned out to break the link urls.
        
        - The lookup window now opens in the directory that was last opened.
        
        - Several reserved ids such as 'home' were declared unreserved
          previously. Unfortunately it turned out that at least 'home' was
          reserved for a good reason, so to be sure re-reserved these ids,
          except for 'search'.
        
        - In the lookupwindowfield, a previously selected value is now shown
          selected.
        
        Silva 2.0
        ---------
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Use layers in our tests.  This makes sure that we can use unittests
          that set up and tear down the component architecture without
          interfering with the components that were set up for the
          integrational tests using the actual Products' ZCML.
        
        - Use `DefaultUnicodeEncodingConflictResolver` instead of the default
          `Z2UnicodeEncodingConflictResolver` for page templates.  This means
          that our page templates will not attempt to implicitly convert to
          something when a string is not unicode and it's not a string
          containing ASCII characters only.
        
        - Removed obsolete five:traversable statements from zcml.
        
        - PageTemplateFile was used with non-existing page templates. This
          used to work in versions prior to Zope 2.10, but failed now. Changed
          __init__.py so that these PageTemplateFile instances are not needed
          anymore.
        
        - Use new MessageFactory from Zope 3.3 to make it compatible with Zope
          2.10
        
        - Changed set_mapping to mapping arguments for message IDs
        
        - Changed css styling of the preview publisher buttons, making easier
          for users to integrate the publisher into their own layout.
        
        - If no title is given, the index is considered a 'pure' anchor, and
          will not be found by Indexers.
        
        - XHTML compliance improvements
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - A security fix in Zope 2.10.3 broke install.py.
        
        Ported from the 1.6 branch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - External sources are removed when extracting the fulltext from a
          document, since the values of the parameters are not necessarily
          meant to be public information.
        
        Silva 1.6
        ---------
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - 2007-03-15: Containers show their modification datetime in the
          'modified' column of the contents table in edit mode.
        
        - If a file or image asset has an extension in its id, this is
          preserved in the fullmedia export, so if the zip file is unzipped
          by hand, the file types of the assets are obvious in those cases,
          and will preview properly in operating systems that support it.
        
        - If present, SilvaLayout will automaticly be registered in
          service_extensions if a new SilvaRoot is created. Note that just
          having the SilvaLayout product on the file system will break the
          ZODB based layout.
        
        - The Extension Service page now has a button 'rebuild catalog' which
          will empty the silva catalog and reindex all silva content.
        
        - Added Atom/RSS feed capabilities to arbitrary containers. To
          use this go to the 'settings' in the properties tab of a
          container, and enable the checkbox marked 'allow feeds'. After
          that, adding /rss.xml or /atom.xml after that container's url
          just works. The feeds, for now, are feeds of only the
          published Silva Documents in that container.
        
        - IVersioning has a method get_first_publication_date, which returns
          the earliest date any version of the content was ever published.
          Useful for RSS/Atom output.
        
        - Silva Find features: When adding a new silvaroot a SilvaFind
          instance named "search" will be placed in the root of the site.
          SilvaFind has many improvements over the SilvaSearch
          functionality, which is still available if you remove or rename the
          SilvaFind instance. For more information on SilvaFind, have a look
          at the SilvaFind README file.
        
        - Automatic fulltext cataloging of pdf files, when the pdftotext
          command-line application is found on the path.
        
        - Automatic fulltext cataloging of word files, when the antiword
          command-line application is found on the path.
        
        - Automatic fulltext cataloging of textfiles using utf8 encoding,
          also the content-type header of textfiles now set the charset to utf8.
        
        - Ghosts now override `get_modification_datetime` to get their
          modification date from the haunted object, allowing the
          `Last-Modified` header to be set in a convenient way.
          (issue 1645)
        
        - Services may now implement
          `Products.Silva.interfaces.IInvisibleService`, which means
          that they want to be excluded from the services listing.
          (issue 1700)
        
        - The published status of containers changed: A folder is published
          when its default document is published, not published when its
          default document isn't published, and if no default document is
          present, it is considered published if any of its contents are
          published. This cuts down on some unnecessary recursion, as well as
          giving editors a nice way to temporarily exclude trees from
          navigation, so that they can be worked on.
        
        - Changed title fields to string fields, for easy FF fill-in
        
        - External sources inside headers or table cells were never allowed. An
          alert box is shown now, to make this clearer. (issue 1578)
        
        - Disabled custom kupu context menu, so that the original browser
          context menu is shown. This allows firefox users to use the firefox
          spellchecker
        
        - Changed the lang attribute of the layout macro html tag to get the
          lang from metadata, as in: https://infrae.com/issue/silva/issue1566
          Lower cased the language codes in the metadata set, as in:
          https://infrae.com/issue/silva/issue1668
        
        - Moved the css selectors for rollover tooltips in Kupu toolboxes
          higher in the cascade so they apply to all toolboxes. Added tooltips
          for the new anchor/index item toolbox and the abbr/acronym toolbox.
        
        - Fixed up the Indexer:
        
          - Add tbody
        
          - Add odd/even cycling for table rows
        
          - Remove double defines
        
          - Fix title for cases where there isn't one
        
          - Fix display for empty indexer
        
          - Reduce arbitrary indenting
        
        - Changed css styling of the preview publisher buttons, making it easier
          for users to integrate the publisher into their own layout.
        
        - Fix for TOCs and AutoTOCS where docs that didn't have a title
          didn't appear because the link was empty (it was there). Now the
          id shows up so visitors can at least click it.
        
        - Renovated the TOC/AutoToc rendering, replacing the ancient, legacy,
          Netscape4 compatible image-based indent, where long titles break
          onto the next, non-indented line. The new rendering uses nested
          lists, which make the rendering easier to style, and more accessible
          to boot. The lists have the class 'toc-list', and the links have the
          'toc-link' class. Added an adapter to perform the new-style
          rendering.
        
        - The new AutoTOC adapter is now used in SilvaDocument TOC rendering,
          for both the widgets- and xslt-based renderers.
        
        - Tocs display links with a trailing slash because there may be
          'edit/tab_preview' appended to it, but this conflicts with links
          made in the editor that are rendered without the slash. Moved the
          slash into the appendage.
        
        - Removed get_layout_macro(.py) from the layout installation code and
          thus it won't be present in the ZODB in future new installs. This is
          legacy code from the doomed layout service development that has now
          been superceded by SilvaLayout. Existing get_layout_macro python
          scripts can be deleted.
        
        - Updated standard_error_message with direct call of
          layout_macro.html, 404 in title, adjusted informative text.
        
        - index items now have an 'index title' attribute in addition to an
          'anchor name' attribute. The title is used for displaying in an
          indexer. The name is used for the anchor, and thus should be a valid
          anchor name. If no title is given, the index is considered a
          'simple' anchor, and will not be found by Indexers.
        
        Ported from 1.5 branch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixes for IE7 css selectors
        
        - With a base tag in the layout template the publisher form in public
          preview 404's. The form now has a constructed action instead of a
          point.  This will work for sites that don't define a base tag too
          (issue1705).
        
        - When there's a base tag in the layout_macro the forms in /public,
          such as the subscription form, return a 404. If the form action is
          constructed using absolute_url, it works. This should also be
          backwards compatible, working for sites that don't include a base
          tag. Tweaked formatting of the search form while at it.
        
        - alt attribute for meta_type icons now have the name of the meta_type
          instead of 'Unknown' (Issue 1654)
        
        - Simplified the content.html layout file to make it easier to
          understand. Moved the content call into the layout macro.
          Reformatted the comments.
        
        - Default installations will have the html meta tags and accessibility
          links skipped in the layout macro to have better out of the box
          performance. Site managers can turn them on as needed.
        
        - 2007-01-24: added an explicit base tag to the layout template, so
          that it no longer includes a trailing slash which zope adds for
          all containerlike objects, which Silva Documents are. This means
          that linking to anchors now works like you would expect it to.
        
        - Changed calls from getMetdata to getMetadataValue where possible,
          resulting in a significant performance gain.
        
        - Non Ascii characters in names or values of codesource paramaters
          no longer result in errors.
        
        - Incorrect links entered by hand or imported broke the path adapter.
          Since this made editing the document impossible, we added some
          defensive code.
        
        - Anchors around divs break in explorer, so they were put inside in
          the xslt renderer.
        
        - i18n problem in views/edit/Asset/File/submit.py (Thanks Benno!)
        
        - Solved problem with trailing slashes in relative Links. (Thanks
          Benno!)
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - 2007-03-15: Ghost and GhostFolder Metadata Access Handlers return
          read only metadata bindings, so that the metadata of the haunted
          original can not be accidentally written to.
        
        - Added a base tag so all Silva screens are based in API space,
          a.k.a. ``*/edit/`` (see issue:
          https://infrae.com/issue/silva/issue1588).
        
        - Having a base tag fixes the potential 404 in the access screen
          (issue 1588).
        
        - Fixed AutoTOC depth feature (issue 1693).
        
        - Fixed behavior in Internet Explorer where it's impossible to change
          the "link to" field in the image toolbox in kupu, by removing the
          onkeypress event.
        
        - Fixed minor bugs in kupu table toolbox where the column widths field
          did not get updated (issue 1577).
        
        - Fixed bug in scaling of images, where images with a scaling of 100%
          would return the modification date of the original hires image,
          creating problems with caching (issue 1557).
        
        - Fix https://infrae.com/issue/silva/issue1642, where the catalog was
          indexing XML tags.
        
        - Fixed id mangling (https://infrae.com/issue/silva/issue1686), spaces
          are no longer allowed in new Ids.
        
        Silva 1.6b4
        -----------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - New version of SilvaMetadata (0.12) released which fixes a bug where
          storing of empty metadata fields/deleting metadata values was
          impossible.
        
        Silva 1.6b3 (first public beta)
        -------------------------------
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Assets now have a version_status method that always returns 'public'
          which means they can be found by SilvaFind.
        
        - Old version cleanup code was made more robust and can now be used to
          delete all old versions older than a certain date, instead of just
          all old versions.
        
        - Silva now uses ZCML for registration of Silva extensions and
          the content types they define. See doc/extension.txt for more
          information. See also doc/developer_changes.txt.
        
        - The Version/CatalogedVersion base class does not expect a title
          argument anymore. This title argument had been unused for a long
          time. This requires minor adjustments in some subclasses of Version
          and CatalogedVersion. For more information see
          doc/developer_changes.txt.
        
        - Much i18n polishing.
        
        - Made image titles required, since they provide the alt attribute.
        
        - Added adapters so we now have a simple API to index, unindex and
          reindex content objects, folders and assets. Adapt to
          Products.Silva.adapters.ICatalogIndexable.
        
        - Moved document info in the document status screen to an info column
          like assets have.
        
        - Refactored/cleaned up tab_status_macros to remove code duplication.
        
        - Changed the add screens for Files and Images so the upload (file)
          field comes first, followed by a subhead 'optional fields', because
          Authors were not seeing the tip that they don't have to fill in an
          id.
        
        - Added a more discreet favicon for the public views.
        
        - For the frontend,css that gets placed in the ZMI, import the
          frontend.css in globals to stop duplication but still give the end
          user the option to edit the preview typography.
        
        - Clarified descriptions of exporting versions.
        
        - Added the possibility of using silva lookup to filter on multiple
          meta-types.
        
        - The import has an extra option: 'replace content' which, when
          enabled, replaces existing content objects with objects from the
          import when they have the same ids. It treats folderish strcutures
          in the same way a POSIX cp would: i.e. in the target folders are
          used if they exist, and created if not.
        
        - Moved the set_content_type and set_cache_headers scripts into the
          new view system, to the view 'headers'.
        
        - Switched to Kupu 1.4 (the current 'trunk' (unreleased) version).
        
        - Moved the 'kupu/silva' directory to 'Silva/kupu' (so to the Silva
          core) to ease release management. If you develop Silva, see
          README.txt in Silva/kupu for information on what to do when you
          change kupu templates, or when Silva needs to be ported to a newer
          version of kupu.
        
        - Renamed 'kupu' and 'kupu_silva' in the Silva root to 'service_kupu'
          and 'service_kupu_silva', respectively.
        
        - Removed old deprecated (de)activation API. For details, see
          'doc/developer_changes.txt'.
        
        Bugs fixed

        - Browser language settings was ignoring English language, meaning it
          would fall back on the first language that was non-English in the
          settings. Now made English is a language explicitly known by Silva
          and SilvaDocument. This also means English can be explicitly
          selected in the user settings view. (issue 1572)
        
        - The user settings view was not dealing with language variants (such
          as zh_TW) correctly. It now displays these and responds to these
          properly.
        
        - User settings view works again. This was broken as Five views were
          in use for header settings. Made header settings view registration
          wider (for everything), and made Member object five:traversable.
        
        - Removed commented out template code for listing all email addresses.
        
        - Fixed various i18n translations in Versioned content
        
        - Fixed public restriction bug cfr. issue 1588 and 1596
        
        - Fixed bug in sidebar uplinks where you couldn't jump up and out of a
          publication.
        
        - TRANSMAP regular expression containing weird characters was not in
          use anymore in Image.py or File.py, so removed it.
        
        - Fix for issue1516: space above kupu in news items. Other extensions
          can control the feedback space too.
        
        - Fixed Issue1449: Siblings Sidebar should display title or id
        
        - Fix for Firefox html edit problem in kupu
        
        - Single paragraphs in table cells were rendered by the xslt as
          opposed to the widget renderer. They are now removed.
        
        - XSLT renderers did not take virtual hosting situations into account
          when rendering images and links in documents.
        
        - In 'normal' headings index items were not rendered by the XSLT
          renderers.
        
        - Added div with css class to make public preview buttons positionable
          in public layouts (they can be behind something if layers are used),
          thus added css class for the form too, and moved local style to the
          css so the stylesheet can be overridden by user.
        
        - The previous fix to the public preview buttons broke keeping the
          user in the same screen when making new versions, i.e. for the
          metadata screen, where when making a new version the user was
          returned to the editor, while in fact metadata needed to be
          edited. Removed a classic very ugly url.
        
        - If a user names the Silva root *root*, it gets priority in the dtml
          namespace, so change the variable in silva.css and frontend.css to
          ``root_url``.
        
        - Full media export/import of images did not take account of format
          scaling and cropping.
        
        - XMLexport of SilvaDocument passed a string instead of an integer to
          ``get_tree```/``get_public_tree``, so limiting the depth of a toc
          while using xslt rendering was ignored.
        
        - Images in tables were not shown correctly in the xslt rendering.
        
        - The zip import of assets (as opposed to the fullmedia zip import)
          did not take into account the 'replace identical ids' option. It
          does now.
        
        - The xslt rendering allowed empty width and height attributes on
          images, which breaks in IE. These are now caught.
        
        - The lookup window had some problems with incorrect content type
          filtering, and a strange javascript issue, where 'document' was
          empty. Both are fixed.
        
        - FSDTMLMethod and FSPageTemplate were imported directly from
          FileSystemSite product instead of from fssite module
        
        - Changed mangle.Path.fromObject() so it doesn't return '' anymore
          when from and to objects are the same.
        
        - Handle user with user id different from login properly (issue 1471)
        
        - Fixed bug in XML export (to_xml()) of Link objects, escaping
          (entitizing) title and url properly now.
        
        - Removed quote (probably typo) from some JS string in
          lookupwindowfield.
        
        - There was a bug in the cleanup script listed in MAINTENANCE.txt,
          fixed.
        
        - Shut up a security deprecation warning for PROPFIND.
        
        Ported from 1.5 branch
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Retain fragment information (#foo) on URLs when converting from URL
          to Zope path and back. This fixes issue 1592.
        
        - User settings screen did not work when user did not have sufficient
          rights in the Silva Root. This is now fixed.
        
        - Fixed problem in SilvaDocument that used kupu where it whasn't
          needed and caused js exceptions.
        
        - Fix for issue 1618 where messagebox didn't appear in ie also removed
          nbsp in ``macro_index``.
        
        - Fixed issues where ``hide_from_toc`` filters wouldn't work in ghost
          contexts.  Also removed some unused cruft from previous filtering
          implementations.
        
        - Added a ReferenceLookupWindowField, to store references to zope
          objects instead of urls.
        
        - Fixed issue 1608 where ``tab_edit_revoke_approval`` caused
          versioning errors.
        
        - In the ``tab_status`` "set timings" caused an error without saving
          the changes and returned a wrong tab
        
        - XML export rewrote the urls of links and images on export, which was
          a bad thing. They now have extra rewritten attributes, which are
          only used by the xslt rendering.
        
        - XML export of Silvadocuments with images that have no link attribute
          was broken.
        
        - The full media export now uses a tempfile instead of an in memory
          stringIO to build the zipfile, hopefully improving memory
          footprint.
        
        - Added an extra note on zope.i18n.translate to
          doc/developer_changes.txt.
        
        - Ghostfolders exported haunted content, which broke asset ids in the
          zip. Since this content was ignored on import it is no longer
          exported.
        
        - Explicitly delete model from request in ``view_version()`` to break
          a cyclic reference that prevents model from being garbage collected.
        
        - Add ZCatalog index upgrader to comply with an API change in Zope.
        
        - The new lookup window was registering resources under the name
          scripts. This name is too broad and was in fact being overridden by
          a Silva extension that introduced its own scripts, causing the Silva
          core to break. Renamed this to ``silva_scripts`` in the core.
        
        - The cropping dialog was broken, fixed.
        
        - Fixed non-interpolation issues with message ids in the image UI.
        
        - Fix in the public preview screen; it broke for ghosts and other
          objects that only register the 'public' view for versions.
        
        - Small context bug fixes in the LookupWindowWidget.
        
        - Some text related to reserved ids wasn't properly translated.
        
        - Failure in user preferences dialog if the browser for some reason
          has no preferred languages configured whatsoever.
        
        - The back button should now always go back to the last edit page
          visited.
        
        - The ``tab_edit_make_copy`` script now redirects to tab_edit instead
          of returning it, fixing a problem with public preview (where
          pressing the back button sometimes caused the make_copy script to
          get triggered) and making the URL in ``tab_edit`` look better after
          creating a new copy.
        
        - File uploads were broken due to a missing ``return_url``
          variable. Fixed.
        
        - Fixed multi-value form element support in external sources.
        
        - Anchor links are rendered in a non-HTML compliant but in a Silva
          backwards compatible way.
        
        - XSLT and widgets based renderer for anchor links are identical.
        
        - Fixed illegal attribute value for cellpadding in XSLT renderer.
        
        - Fixed unicode error in approval.
        
        - GhostFolders (and probably also Ghosts) could mess up SilvaLayout if
          they referred to a location with a different skin setting than the
          location in which the GhostFolder is accessed (even when just
          looking at its title). This has now been fixed.

        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Already available in beta 1, but not in our HISTORY.txt
          file. Buttons have been added to the UI to publish and close content
          more directly.
        
        - Added the newest translations from the Launchpad Rosetta system.
          (https://launchpad.net/products/silva/+translations)
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Container policies are not hardcoded anymore for container add
          forms (add folder or add publication). Instead, the
          information on what container policies are available is
          retrieved from the service where they are registered.
        
        - A lot more places where i18n interpolation wasn't taking place
          anymore (${foo} in message texts) are fixed by using an
          explicit call to zope.i18n.translate() instead of unicode().
        
        - Restore "install default layout" functionality for ZODB
          layout; we were too vigorous in removing layout related code
          and removed too much.
        
        - Removed some more traces of FileSystemSite-based layout system.
        
        - Some fixes in the refactored lookup window code.
        
        - Some cleanups of GhostFolder code, fixing an error that
          appeared when Five views interacted with them.
        
        - Fix in Ghost code stops another error related to Five view
          interaction with acquisition.
        
        - Eliminated Zope 2.8.5 warnings on startup.
        
        - Access screen can be accessed again by authors.
        
        - Slight simplification of icon generation code which in some
          circumstances gave rise to a bug.
        
        - get_layout_macro was stored with DOS line endings, switched to Unix
          to be in line with the rest of the source code.
        
        - Further bugfixes in Kupu and Kupu integration, includes Kupu 1.3.5.
        
        1.5b1
        -----
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Changed over Silva so it works with Zope 2.8/Five/Zope 3
          interfaces instead of old-style interfaces. See
          doc/developer_changes for more details. These interfaces were
          in SilvaLayout as marker interfaces in the past.
        
        - Adjusted test infrastructure so it works with Five.
        
        - Use Zope 2.8 style transactions.
        
        - Changed over Silva so it works with the Five/Zope 3 translation
          architecture, using Five. See doc/developer_changes for more
          details.
        
        - Some parts of the Silva UI (for instance the lookup window in the
          edit views) are now based on Zope 3 adapters and views, using Five.
          This is a first step of a long evolutionary transition for the Silva
          UI.
        
        - Converted IViewerSecurity, IIndexable, IHaunted, IAssetData to Zope
          3 adapters.
        
        - The silva-extra metadata set now has a language field that stores a
          ISO 639 two letter language code.
        
        - Language setting in the user preferences is now shown as human
          readable text, not as a language code. Moreover, using Zope 3's
          locale database, names for languages are shown in the configured
          language.
        
        - Added support for Kupu 1.3.4.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added missing 'is_default' method on SilvaObject, it was already
          available on Content but some new functionality (closing objects
          from tab_edit of Container types) made that it was required for
          other types as well.
        
        - Never really an official feature, the FileSystemSite-based layout
          system has been removed from the code. This means that
          service_layouts is now gone.
        
        - Kupu now uses frontend.css instead of an almost entire copy.
        
        - Moved 'get_extsource_url.py' out of SilvaDocument to the core to
          allow using it from other products.
        
        1.4.1
        -----
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added support for Kupu 1.3.2, in which a SilvaExternalSources
          related bug is fixed.
        
        - Fixed unicode bug in table rendering.
        
        - SilvaDocument's 'fulltext' method returns a list as it did in the
          past, now that Zope has been bugfixed to handle this again.
        
        - Fallback so that interlaced PNG files now work with Silva Images,
          even though thumbnails are disabled in that case.
        
        1.4
        ---
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added a JavaScript registry for onload handlers and used that to
          do some refactoring of the tab_edit pagetemplates.
        
        - Added support for Kupu 1.3.
        
        - Added a field to the silva-extra metadata-set: hide_from_tocs.
          By default set to do not hide, when this is set to hide on a piece
          of content, that content (and what it contains) will not show up in
          tables of content.
        
        - Added a link_type attribute to Link (Version) objects. Adding
          relative links is now possible.
        
        - Browsing to objects (for e.g. link and image lookups) has been
          refactored, now there's only a single implementation of the lookup
          window, and somewhat cleaner HTML.
        
        - It is now possible to have table cells without a width attribute,
          which means you can style your tables through css entirely. To use
          this feature, give the column widths a value of '*'.
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Un-fixed a Zope-2.7.7 compatibility issue with using ZCTextIndex.
          The original fix was basically a work arround for Zope bug. This
          means Silva can no longer work properly with Zope-2.7.7.
        
        - Updated tests/README.txt to reflect the now preferred way for
          running the tests. ZopeTestCase-0.9.8 is now required.
        
        - When content without a maintitle was exported, it could not be
          imported again.
        
        - Image tags in exported silva documents had their src attribute
          converted to an absolute url on export.
        
        - In some cases the registered upgraders for the new Silva version
          would not run. This is fixed by regsitering upgraders for all Silva
          versions, even if the particular version didn't really have any
          upgrading to do.
        
        - Saving metadata in tab_metadata did not trigger a catalog reindex
          action.
        
        - The test_subscriptions would fail if the MaildropHost was installed.
        
        - pathToUrl() (path.py) has been renamed to pathToUrlPath(). Fixed
          tests accordingly.
        
        - Various issues in Kupu have been addressed.
        
        - Fixed various unicode errors related to PTS.
        
        - Fixed bug where En didn't appear in the language list.
        
        - i18n cleanups.
        
        1.3
        ---
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - All Silva css files (silva, silvaContentStyle, frontend) have been
          cleaned up, a table of contents added, and the properties have been
          reordered following W3C recommendations. They validate.
        
        - The border color of focused form fields highlights.
        
        - Editable metadata fields now have labels, allowing the field to be
          focused with a mouse click.
        
        - The content workspace now has a sidebar, which displays siblings of
          the item in the current folder.
        
        - The middleground of properties and its subscreens is now handled by
          a macro.
        
        - A macro_nonscreen has been added, for situations where the user clicks
          to a screen that doesn't exist, e.g. there is no addables screen for
          folders, but the user can navigate to it via the sidebar.
        
        - macro_index has been cleaned up, and doesn't try to load Kupu unless
          Kupu is needed.
        
        - The service_subscriptions has a service icon.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed a bug in the editor transformations that made that external
          source form fields couldn't contain non-ascii characters in Kupu.
        
        - Fixed the naive inclusion of Silva extensions in view trees, which
          caused an AttributeError on service_views when a view-less
          extension, like SilvaLayout, was installed.
        
        - Cosmetic improvements to the public Indexer rendering.
        
        - Changed the xmlimporter to import metadata sets that are actually
          present in the import instead of iterating over all installed metadata
          sets.
        
        - Fixed a unicode bug in the xmlimporter.
        
        - Fixed an API incompatibility with Zope 2.7.7 ZCTextIndex (fix works
          with 2.7.6 as well).
        
        - Suppressed the xsltrenderer's copying of silva related namespace
          attributes and declarations in rendered html.
        
        - Fixed a bug where unknown classnames used on p-tags (usually after
          copy/paste to Kupu) confused the editor and widget renderer.
        
        - The user clipboard no longer hits the right side of the window.
        
        - Numerous i18n bugs have been fixed.
        
        - The form field widths have been fixed in the csv source edit screen.
        
        - Various bugs and the layout have been fixed in tab_status_macros.
        
        - If a document heading is empty, an empty h2 tag is not rendered.
        
        - Feedback in user settings (always saying the language has been
          edited, even if it wasn't) has been fixed.
        
        - Access keys in the contents screen have been fixed, so it is now
          possible to add items using just the keyboard.
        
        - A bug in the select_all macro js has been fixed.
        
        - Fixed incompatibility of code source forms between editors, requires
          Kupu 1.3 (issue 1351).
        
        - Fixed problem with paths, that made that if you'd revoke a pending
          version of an object using the button in tab_edit of that object and
          then would edit it with Kupu, saving would fail (issue 1345).
        
        - Fixed hyperlink support in headings in Kupu (issue 1324).
        
        - Fixed the request approval button (issue 1337).
        
        - Removed 'publish now' button from the public preview screen for
          authors (who are not allowed to publish anything) (issue 1369).
        
        - Fixed image cropping button (issue 921).
        
        - Fixed charset problems in public/subscriptor view (issue 1357).
        
        - Fixed modification time in tab_status' version management table (issue
          1355).
        
        - Fixed SilvaMetadata tests (XML validation problem) (issue 1354).
        
        - Fixed AttributeError (__call__) on DummyMessageID (issue 1342).
        
        - Fixed some bugs in Image, when an image was stored on the FS and
          removed, a Silva Image object referring to it didn't work anymore
          (issue 1350).
        
        - Added 'X-Is-Fallback-For' directive in the appropriate .po files
          (providing information about fallbacks for e.g. de-ch to de)
          (issue 1305).
        
        - After a cut/paste action, the paste buttons now (correctly)
          disappear from view (issue 1326).
        
        - Fixed problems with IE mangling URLs (hrefs of anchors and src for
          images), by storing an additional attribute and reading that if
          available. Requires Kupu 1.2.2.
        
        - Fixed bug in exporting ZODB-based files to the filesystem (for
          ExtFile), which also fixed a unit test (issue 1384).

        -----
        
        Note: there were a couple internal betas, this is the first public one.
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - WebDAV support for Silva. Silva can now be accessed by a WebDAV
          client.
        
        - User interface refactoring for the properties (metadata) tab, and
          settings tab.
        
        - Silva users can now set their preferred language on the user
          settings page if PTS is installed. The preference is stored in a
          cookie which expires after one year.
        
        - Partial upgrades, an feature that allows upgrading imported
          Z-exported Silva content. This feature should be handled with care,
          as it cannot always be guaranteed to be correct.
        
        - Public preview mode now has a back button to go back to the
          Silva UI. For EXISTING SILVA SETUPS, the preview_html Python
          script in the Silva root needs to be edited so it reads:
          return context.index_html(view_method='public_preview')
          (change 'preview' to 'public_preview').
        
        - Metadata sets can have a 'category' property. This property
          can be used to define special purpose metadata sets.
        
        - The minimal_role and category properties are exported and
          imported to/from the XML metadata set definitions.
        
        - Export button in publish screen was replaced to a more logical
          location.
        
        - The publish screen controls have been reorganized and a publish
          now button has been added, saving users a click (the publish now
          checkbox is gone).
        
        - A publish now button has been added to almost all screens where a
          user my want to publish now, including contents, preview, public
          preview, propoerties and its subscreens.
        
        - Users can close and publish (now) content in the contents screen.
          This makes moving of items much easier, obviating the need to switch
          to the publish screen to close.
        
        - Both the contents and the publish screen have import and export
          (transport) buttons.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - RNG schemas are up-to-date.
        
        - Optimizations in xml export:
            * Do not use the wrappers for the dom, but the DOM directly.
            * Improved metadata values handling
        
        - URLs generated by Indexers, now point to the correct anchors in
          the documents referenced.
        
        - Fixed issue1246, where the cropbox didn't work correctly.
        
        - Saving metadata uses Formulator forms for improved validation.
        
        - The import/export of metadata values other than string now works
          correctly. (previously only datetime values were, hackishly, checked
          for.) This requires an update of Formulator.
        
        - Fixed acquistion problem with ExternalSource objects and Kupu: when
          adding or updating an ExternalSource object that had an id that
          returned another object using acquisition, Kupu would display a 404
          page instead of the source's form. This has now been fixed: instead
          of acquisition of the id a full url is used to find the source.
          Note that this requires Kupu 1.2.1+.
        
        - Fixed issue 1275, copy/paste and cut/paste now queries Zope for the
          ids it has generated rather than generating them in sync (which was
          broken due to a change in Zope's renaming behaviour).
        
        - Fixed issue 1224, the 'model' variable inside the form of external
          sources now points to the document in which the code source element
          was embedded rather than to the code source itself. Note that this
          requires Kupu 1.2.1 and SilvaExternalSources 0.10.2.
        
        - Fix unicode issues in SilvaDocument (if
          PlacelessTranslationService is used) by introducing a
          safeJoin() operation.
        
        - Fixed issue 1277, unicode error in membership form saving mechanism.
        
        - Fixed broken i18n:name (string interpolation) in user lookup screen.
        
        - Fixed issue 1288, tab_status_approve should never create copies
          anymore without publishing them.
        
        - Fixed issue 1311, some problems with nested lists in Kupu.
        
        - Fixed issue 1301, Kupu now uses object.get_title() where appropriate.
        
        - Updated Silva software version number to 1.3
        
        1.2
        ---
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - batch.py now imports make_request from ZTUtils.Zope, seems to
          fix some test failures.
        
        - layout service doesn't render pages when called from Python.
        
        1.2b1
        -----
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Silva has been i18n-ed. (Works with Placeless Translation Service
          1.0). There's an English, German and Dutch version of Silva now.
        
        - Subscriptions feature: visitors can now easily subscribe to
          publish events of VersionedContent objects (like Silva Documents).
          If a visitor is subscribed, he will receive notifications by email
          whenever a publication event for this object is triggered.
        
        - Version management feature:
        
          * reviewing older versions of content objects
        
          * comparing different versions side-by-side
        
          * reverting to older versions of content
        
          * removal of selected old versions
        
        - When ExtFile is installed, a site manager can switch between ZODB
          storage and file system storage of assets with one click of a
          button.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed a bug in the xml exporter that tripped on the export of
          citatation elements
        
        - Link objects now accept other protocols in the URL too (https,
          news, ftp, mailto).
        
        - Fixed a bug in the xml importer that could result in loss of text
          data.
        
        - Fixed color of error display when something could not be pasted.
          Note: see doc/developer_changes.txt for information about the impact
          this change had on the API.
        
        - Removed namespace declaration from XML produced by Kupu.
        
        - Fixed standard_error_message, it's now displayed properly when a
          user chooses 'cancel' when the browser asks for login credentials.
        
        - Fixed problem with vanishing paragraphs after a Kupu save.
        
        - Fixed case where XSLT renderer produced non-HTML tags.
        
        
        1.1.2
        -----
        
        1.1.1
        -----
        
        Features Added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added a new xslt renderer that renders Silva Documents without a
          title at the top.
        
        - Made kupu the default editor if available.
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - TOC rendered with the XSLT renderer now use the correct context.
        
        - Fixed a nasty unicode error in the XSLT renderer, that somehow
          slips through in Zope 2.7.2 and only breaks Silva in 2.7.3
        
        - Fixed issue where is_published return true in situations where
          there isn't any viewable content.
        
        - URLs are now rendered correctly in the context of a Ghost object.
        
        - Added 'Delete objects' permission to authors and up, this was not
          used in previous Zope versions but is in 2.7.3.
        
        - Fixed bug that made Internet Explorer generate paths to images in
          Kupu that couldn't be reached by unauthorized users (issues 1165
          and 1168).
        
        - Updated footer of the Silva documentation template, used to mention
          incorrect Silva and Zope versions.
        
        - Fixed bug with metadata sets with restricted access, they were not
          accessible with people who did have the required role(s) but didn't
          have them defined on the root.
        
        - Headings are no longer incorrectly discarded by the xslt renderer.
        
        - Code and data sources no longer incorrectly copy their parameters
          into the result html.
        
        - Images in SilvaDocuments now get their widths, heights, aligments
          and titles in the xml export, which fixes some bugs in the xslt
          rendering.
        
        - Tables should have a width of 100%, but this got removed in 1.0
        
        - Nested lists only worked in the xslt renderers when the outer list
          was bulleted. Nested lists can now have any type normal lists can.
        
        - Newlines can be used instead of <br> in the forms editor.
        
        - Markup and linebreaks within tables is no longer removed in the xslt
          renderers.

        - Allowed access to the cleanup adapter from Python scripts.
        
        - Streamlined the creation of XSLT renderers.
        
        - All objects with renderers registered for them have a way to turn
          new-style rendering off explicitly for that object in particular
          (not just in renderer registry).
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Replaced print statement in Indexer for a LOG entry.
        
        - The Indexer could break when the content tree it indexed contains
          Silva Publications.
        
        - Protect methods on the ``service_files``.
        
        - Content publication state is now not touched anymore when imported
          using ``*.zexp`` files in the ZMI.
        
        - zip-file XML import/export of Silva root should now work.
        
        - Unused XSLT support cruft has been cleaned up.
        
        - Fixed problem with very long titles and ids in lookup screens,
          they're truncated now.
        
        - Ghosts and ghost folders should import properly with zip file
          import.
        
        - Fixed incorrect recursive call for ``get_public_tree_helper``.
        
        Removals
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        - Remnant of SQLDataSource removed. Use SilvaExternalSources instead.
          (SQLDataSource was deprecated since version 0.9.3).
        
        - Remnants of old archive file import code (for bulk creation of
          assets) has been removed. Use the archivefileimport adapter instead.
        
        1.1 beta 2
        ----------
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Revision of the XSLT support so that it can work with any object in
          Silva, not just Silva Document. The properties tab and
          service_renderer_registry also now take this into account. If you're
          upgrading from 1.1b1, please remove service_renderer_registry in the
          ZMI and do a refresh all in service_extensions to install a new one.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Remnants of old parser code in SilvaDocument (silvaparser.py,
          search.py) and all references to it have been removed. In
          EditorSupportNested the render_links method has been removed - this
          might break old extensions.
        
        - Remove a memory leak from XSLT support.
        
        - Some fixes for the full-media import/export system.
        
        - The 'get link reference' buttons in the forms-based editor now
          return the new-style HTML subset references.
        
        - The forms-based editor now highlights index items correctly in
          nested lists and tables.
        
        - Fixed the rename form for objects with no title.
        
        1.1 beta 1
        ----------
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - XSLT support for rendering Silva objects. See
          doc/renderers_howto.txt for more information.
        
        - New parser for SilvaDocument forms-based editor, using a HTML subset
          instead of the old-style method using special characters.
        
        - A new XML export/system that can also export and import asset data.
        
        - abbr and acronym support for both forms editor and Kupu.
        
        - Implemented get_public_tree_all(depth) method.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Silva File and Image asset use settings from the 'nearest' (by
          acquisition) service_files again.
        
        - Do not copy over properties anymore when changing a folder to
          publication or back. Silva does not use properties anymore.
        
        - Properties tab for Ghost Folder works again.
        
        - Fixed bug in images that caused a ZODB transaction on every public
          view.
        
        - Fixed kupu transformation bug that made paragraph type not come
          through on save.
        
        - The target attribute was not taken into account in the silva xml ->
          kupu html transformation. Fixed.
        
        - Fixed unicode issues in Groups support. This is only an issue for
          Membership extensions that allow non-ascii characters in their group
          names, for instance the ones based on LDAP. Core groups support is
          not affected by this change.
        
        1.0 final
        ---------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Made the 0.9.3-1.0 Image upgrade even more forgiving, basically it
          will now not break on anything anymore, it will print a warning to
          the zLOG on every exception.
        
        - Problem in Kupu transformations that made 'spurious' <p> elements
          without content appear on the page.
        
        - Problem in Kupu transformations that made <div>'s get removed
          completely from a document on save: now instead of removing it it's
          contents get converted and added to the document.
        
        - Issue 942: quotes in links around images broke the public view.
        
        - Added refresh all to update.
        
        - Issues 996 and 998: changed image links that pointed to the hires
          version of the image, instead of pointing to <image>/hires_image
          they now point to <image>?hires.
        
        - Minor problem where the image edit form in the form editor didn't
          recognize a link as one to the hires version of the image.
        
        - Added test cases for get_creation_datetime() and
          get_modification_datetime() in SilvaObject. Also re-enabled and
          revised some tests that were commented out in test_SilvaObject.
        
        - Indexer is now updated when installation documentation.

          accidentally triggered an experimental layout service.
        
        - Fixed bug in Kupu transformations that broke tables with incomplete
          alignment information.
        
        - Made the 0.9.3-1.0 Image upgrade a bit more forgiving, which may
          result in broken images but at least lets the upgrade continue.

          accessible.
        
        1.0 (release candidate 2)
        -------------------------
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Silva picks up version from version.txt in more places so that less
          code needs to be updated before each release.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Empty index elements [[]] are now longer accepted.

        1.0 (release candidate 1)
        -------------------------
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Kupu, a WYSIWYG editor for Silva Document. This editor offers
          a load of new features:
        
          - full Silva integration; Kupu knows about special Silva
            elements and saves Silva XML
        
          - Copy and paste HTML from any source into Kupu.
        
          - works in Internet Explorer (5.5 and higher) and Mozilla
        
          Kupu was formerly known as Epoz 1.0.
        
        - Extensive documentation released along with Silva, and can be
          automatically installed.
        
        - All images of a Silva Image asset are stored in the filesystem if
          ExtFile is available and the corresponding option is set in
          service_files. Also better support for ExtFile's static serving was
          introduced. service_files allows to convert the storage method of
          all Silva Image assets.
        
        - Image scaling supports "keep aspect ratio" now. You can scale with
          ``120x*`` or ``*x211`` to fix width or height.
        
        - An Image has a thumbnail now, retrievable via ``foo.jpg?thumbnail``.
        
        - Cropper tool - Silva now provides facilities for cropping
          images. This tool combines with the scaling possibilities to give
          authors the means to both scale and resize a high resolution image
          to web format.
        
        - Images can be viewed without the ``/image`` at the end (issue 594),
          the high resolution version can be retrieved via ``foo.jpg?hires``.
        
        - Supporting a newer, improved version of ExtFile.
        
        - Performance improvements in contents screen for folders, icon
          presentation, and metadata system.
        
        - Numerous tweaks in the UI.
        
        - Revision of the archive file import (i.e. zipfile import)
          functionality. Mimetypes can be registered for specific Asset
          types. The importer will create Assets depending on the mimetype.
        
        - Silva now should deliver the right mime type for HEAD requests.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - When run with Python 2.3 in 2.7 (not yet recommended by Infrae for
          Silva 1.0), suppress source code encoding warnings when starting up.
        
        - Another problem with the upgrade code for handling index elements,
          which causes a few of them to be missed, has been repaired.
        
        - Ghost Folders now can be added by Editors (required Manager role
          previously)
        
        - Groups are installable as specified in the UI (no more KeyError).
        
        - The File asset behaves more like the Image asset, where the URL to
          the object now will return the actual data. This obsoletes the need
          for URL's like "path/to/some/file/download'.
        
        - A long standing problem with occasional InvalidObjectReference
          errors when installing or refreshing Silva should now be fixed.
        
        0.9.3.4
        -------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - A problem in the upgrade code handling index elements in Silva
          Documents was repaired.
        
        0.9.3.3
        -------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Smaller bugfixes in the silvaparser.
        
        - created a new method addAddable on ExtensionRegistry. This makes it
          possible (again) to add classes to Silva without being required to
          name your class the same as the module name (which the registerClass
          method needs). You simply register your class the normal way with
          Zope, and then invoke addAddable for its meta type.
        
        - Fixed acquisition for viewing locally defined roles on Silva
          objects. (For instance: if user1 has editor role on pub1, and not on
          pub2, viewing /pub1/pub2/foo/tab_access shouldn't show user1 as an
          editor, and now doesn't).
        
        0.9.3.2
        -------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Make render_icon create absolute URLs again for better
          cacheability.
        
        - Fixed the silva parser where a specific portnumber in the URL would
          not get recognized.
        
        - Improved link parser for anchors and query fragments.
        
        0.9.3.1
        -------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Improvements in the upgrade code, esp. for large databases.
        
        - Fixed bug in displaying the "allowed" addables.
        
        0.9.3
        -----
        
        Author visible changes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Container objects (e.g. Folder, Publications and the Silva Root) now
          have a title independent of the index document inside the
          container. The title is set during the creation of the container and
          can be changed using the rename button in the folder edit- or
          properties tab.
        
        - "Container policies" - When creating a new container object the
          author can choose the tpye of the index object being created, or not
          to create an index object at all. The options presented can be
          extended.
        
        - Import assets from a zipfile now creates Silva Folder for the
          zipfiles's directory structure.
        
        - Ghosts have a 'get reference' button now.
        
        - Silva Files now have their icon dependent on the content. I.e. you
          get a pdf icon if you uploaded a pf file. Currently there are icons
          for PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint.
        
        - Added GhostFolder: While a ghost haunts a content objects a
          GhostFolder haunts a container.
        
        - There is a new Link object for creating references to external sites
          that can become part of navigation and TOC.  This link object
          redirects to the external site when accessed.
        
        - The Document text markup parser has been rewritten and is able to
          deal with more forms of input properly. There are a number of
          improvements to the way hyperlinks and indexables work.
        
        - New 'annotation' paragraph type.
        
        - Headings in Silva Documents now allow superscript, subscript and
          emphasis markup.
        
        - Numerous UI tweaks.
        
        Chief editor visible changes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added IP Groups. This replaces the 'restriction by IP address' text
          area in tab_access.
        
        - Added Viewer + and Viewer ++ roles for higher view
          restrictions. Redid the user interface and underlying code for
          setting this.
        
        Site developer visible changes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Deprecated SQL Data Source assets in favor of the
          SilvaExternalSources extension. Existing SQL Data Source assets
          continue to work, but no new SQL Data Sources can be added to the
          Silva tree. In future Silva versions SQL Data Source assets may stop
          working. Add an external source in the editor using 'External
          Source' (not 'External Data', which is way to add the deprecrated
          SQL Data Source assets).
        
        - Improved virtual hosting support. Both the public screens as well as
          the Silva edit screens should behave better in the presence of
          virtual hosting. Public view caching such as for Silva Document has
          also been made virtual host aware.
        
        - Documents now index title along with document XML contents in
          fulltext indexing.
        
        - Error messages in public sites should now be shown within the
          context of the public template (if standard_error_message is
          replaced in the Silva root or if a new Silva root is created).
        
        - Some infrastructure is now in place to drive workflow from an
          outside process like a cron job. This is needed to keep the catalog
          and thus search functionality up to date if publication dates are
          set in the future or expiration dates are used.
        
        - DemoObject is removed from the core in favor of a (to be
          developed/updated) demo extension.
        
        Technical changes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added API to membership system so that extra columns can be defined
          for lookup results by plugin membership components.
        
        - Merged silva.css and ploneCustom.css (removed ploneCustom) to reduce
          hits and processing.
        
        - service_utils went away. All functionality moved to mangle.py
        
        - Checks for valid IDs are all moved to a separate module.
        
        - Silva Document and editor functionality is split from the Silva core
          into a separate SilvaDocument product. This is still very much tied
          to the core in this release however, so changes are noted in this
          HISTORY file for the time being.
        
        - Silva Views machinery is split out from the Silva core into
          SilvaViews product.
        
        - New SilvaExternalSources product replacing both code element and
          SQLSource assets. This makes it possible to pass parameters to
          external sources (a feature missing in code element). They also plug
          into the document caching framework.
        
        - Added functionality to use CMFCore DirectoryView infrastructure
          instead of FileSystemSite, through the fssite.py module. Importing
          from the CMFCore is turned off right now, though.
        
          All uses of FileSystemSite functionality in Silva should now
          import through this module.
        
        - Errors that are displayed in the Silva user interface now don't
          result in ZODB database commits.
        
        - A new Silva unit testing framework that is based on the ZopeTestCase
          system (http://www.zope.org/Members/shh/ZopeTestCase) allows much
          higher performance and less hackery for running unit tests.  See the
          README.txt in the tests directory for more information.
        
        - publication and modification datetime support is now not dependent
          on ZODB bobobase_modification_datetime anymore but is hooked into
          the metadata system.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed rare or edge-case situations in the Publish tab. UI
          improvements, bugfixes and some code optimizations.
        
        - Renaming publishables no longer changes ordering (issue 635)
        
        - In the Docma queues, the fullname of the job owner is now shown
          instead of the userid, which was seen as a security issue by some
          customers.
        
        - Fixed unicode issue when deleting a table column
        
        - XML export permissions rationalized: it is now accessible to
          people having ReadSilvaContent permission.
        
        - Access restriction by IP used to rely on Zope Properties;
          this doesn't happen anymore since we migrated to IP groups.
        
        - Some cleanups in what is indexed in the catalog.
        
        - Can add a new Silva root with non-ascii (latin1) characters
          in the title.
        
        
        0.9.2.6
        -------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fulltext also indexes title, not just XML content
        
        - Fixed some unicode errors in the EmailMessageService.
        
        - Cache is now bypassed if 'suppress_title' is in the request.
        
        0.9.2.5
        -------
        
        Features Added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Image elements in a Silva Document now have to possibility to link
          to the hires version or other URLs with a optional "_target".
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - No Catalog indexes are created for Metadata fields which do not need
          indexing.
        
        - Metadata form and acquisition didn't work properly in all cases.
        
        - UI improvements in tab_edit and tab_publish.
        
        - XML export of folders when the "export last version" option is
          checked, did not use correct Folder title.
        
        - Fixed two issues with the SQLDataSource and integer fields: the code
          doesn't try to convert the contents of the field to unicode anymore
          if it's not a plain string (fails with integers) and the code
          doesn't change the contents of the field to '' anymore when it's
          something else than None (previously it checked whether it resolved
          to true instead of checking for None).
        
        - View caching should now be more efficient as cachability
          check is now only made once for each new publish event. The
          view caching framework now also has some unit tests.
        
        0.9.2.4
        -------
        
        Features Added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Import assets from a zipfile now creates Silva Folder for the
          zipfiles's directory structure.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed bug where the widget caches were not cleared correctly upon
          deletion of a Document.
        
        - Fixed rare or edge-case situations in the Publish tab. UI
          improvements, bugfixes and some code optimizations.
        
        - SilvaMetadata contained a bug which actually made metadata
          cataloging fail. This has been fixed in SilvaMetadata 0.7.2, so the
          only upgrade necessary is in fact of this dependency. For
          convenience we've also done a new Silva release, but the only thing
          it contains is one new test for getting metadata.
        
        0.9.2.3
        -------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Authors can now create new document versions again. This was a
          permission setting problem. It can be fixed by going to
          service_extensions and pressing 'refresh' for the Silva core.
        
        - Fixed two issues with the SQLDataSource and integer fields: the code
          doesn't try to convert the contents of the field to unicode anymore
          if it's not a plain string (fails with integers) and the code
          doesn't change the contents of the field to '' anymore when it's
          something else than None (previously it checked whether it resolved
          to true instead of checking for None).
        
        - Fixed a whole host of issues related to indexing. Indexing of
          objects was both done incorrectly and the performance was too
          slow. test_catalog was added which can be used to test indexing
          correctness, and fixes were made where problems were found. Indexing
          performance was increased by:
        
          * Avoiding indexing something too frequently in the Silva core.
        
          * Improving Formulator so that TALES expressions are cached. This
            avoids a massive Python expression compilation overhead. Upgrade
            Formulator to version 1.5.0 for a massive boost in indexing
            performance.
        
          * Fixing Silva metadata to avoid quadratic behavior while
            indexing. Previously, for n elements that are indexed, for each
            element indexing the data for the n indexes was accessed,
            resulting in quadratic behavior while indexing (n * n values were
            accessed per object). Upgrade SilvaMetadata to version 0.7.1 for
            another boost in indexing performance.
        
          * Fulltext indexing of unapproved versions is avoided.
        
          * Old versions should now not show up in the catalog anymore.
        
        - Fix icon rendering. It should now be faster and more browser-cache
          friendly.
        
        - Fixed unicode issue when deleting a table column.
        
        - A number of things fixed in 0.9.1.x have also been fixed
          for 0.9.2.
        
        0.9.2.2
        -------
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - get CSS style iteration right for containers only containing
          Assets (which otherwise would break the container view).
        
        - Add a silva root in the ploneCustom style sheet for the
          tabbar background images (which would not display if the
          silva root folder did not have 'silva' for id and be located
          directly in the zope root).
        
        - Be less aggressive about trying to add a Unicode Whitespace
          splitter, and accept if one is already there.
        
        - Changed check_reserved_ids() function in the content upgrade
          script from breadth-first to depth-first. This works better for
          content hierarchies where folders with an invalid id containing
          content also with invalid ids, are being renamed.
        
        - The metadata tab wouldn't show the metadata set's title when it
          was available.
        
        0.9.2.1
        -------
        
        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added support for ExternalEditor, Silva Files and Images can now
          be edited using your favorite editor
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fix bug where viewing content normally restricted by an
          AccessRestriction, could be viewed via a Ghost.
        
        - Pressing upgrade more than once now doesn't mess up object titles
          anymore
        
        - All content types should now have the correct metadata sets setup
          for them (led to a KeyError on 'silva-extra' in all of the views
          of those content types)
        
        0.9.2
        -----
        
        Features Added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Bulk import of files (for File Assets) and/or images (for Image
          Assets) using a zipfile.
        
        - New metadata architecture, which provides multiple configurable
          metadata sets. Sets can defined on a per object type basis and
          uses the catalog to make this metadata searchable.
        
        - Unicode support. All content and meta data can contain any character
          defined by the unicode standard. On upgrade you have replace or
          update your index_html set the the correct encoding; the default
          index_html does this.
        
        - Sidebar caching. For performance reasons, the sidebar is now cached,
          making it possible to use it throughout the site without slowing
          down page rendering.
        
        - High resolution image support. If you have PIL installed images can
          be both converted to JPEG or PNG and arbitrary scaled for web
          presentation. The high resolution image can be used for printing.
        
        - Asset references and code element references will now be relative
          paths if the Assets are in the same container the Document is in,
          or in a subcontainer of this container. If not, the path will be
          an absolute path.
        
        - Docma queue viewer is now on both import and export screen. On import
          only Silva XML files are shown, on export only Word documents.
        
        - Export screen prefills email address and description.
        
        - Single Document import/export
        
        - Markup character escapes (entities)
        
        - Titles are now associated to document versions, not documents
          themselves. Different versions can have different titles.
        
        - Some XMLWidgets related cleanups to the editor.
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - (SQL)Datasources can now only be placed by ChiefEditors and up
          (using a Datasource in a document is not affected by this), and
          (SQL)Datasources now work with unicode.
        
        - The widgets cache would be cleared correctly upon Document
          deletion. This could result in inconsistent Document editor states
          if this Document has an id earlier held by a Document now deleted.
        
        - Setting a TOC level would display one level too much.
        
        - Fixed problems arising from allowing to create content objects which
          may shadow important internal objects (issue321) or cause unfriendly
          Zope error messages (issue189)
        
        - A number of minor bugs, mainly in UI.
        
        0.9.1.5
        -------
        
        Features Added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added support for ExternalEditor, Silva Files and Images can
          now be edited using your favorite editor.
        
        - Bulk import of files (for File Assets) and/or images (for Image
          Assets) using a zipfile. Note though, that the 091 id
          checking is less tolerant compared to the 092 id checking.
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Removed "Asset reference" asset-type stickyness.
        
        - Fixed button for refresh queue when Docma is enabled.
        
        - Added a find_indexers utility (accesible through
          http://server/silva/edit/service_utils/find_indexers) to find all
          Indexer objects in use.
        
        - Help text opens in new browser window.
        
        - Indexer -all non-versioned content actually- can now be deleted.
        
        - Indexer objects now render the correct URLs in virtual host
          situations. Use the 'update index' in the edit tab of Indexer
          objects to get the Indexers up to date.
        
        - Setting a TOC level would display one level too much.
        
        - Pressing 'Export' in Document's status tab now takes a user to the
          export screen of the container so the user can indeed (as the text
          suggests) export to Docma as well as download the content.
        
        0.9.1.4
        -------
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The UI for 'Access Restriction by Role' did not properly expose the
          possibility to set this role more restrictive on a lower level. (the
          pull down menu and button would have been disabled).
        
        - get_public_tree() would not do the right thing with the depth- level
          control argument.
        
        0.9.1.3
        -------

        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed situation where authors could not move items to other
          positions in the folders.
        
        - Fixed bug where no asset could be added in the asset lookup dialog
          when no previous assets where available in this folder.
        
        - Images nested in tables now keep their <a href="..."> tag (if set on
          the image element).
        
        - Ghosts of Documents containing a TOC will render this TOC with the
          Ghost's container context and not with the container context of the
          target Document.
        
        - Fixed unwanted aquisition behaviour of Ghost paths and other
          improvements in the Ghost code.
        
        0.9.1.2
        -------

        - Backport of the multipe file repositories ability.
        
        - Backport of single Document import/export.
        
        - Asset references and code element references will now be relative
          paths if the Assets are in the same container the Document is in, or
          in a subcontainer of this container. If not, the path will be an
          absolute path.
        
        - Docma queue viewer is now on both import and export screen. On
          import only Silva XML files are shown, on export only Word
          documents.
        
        - Export screen prefills email address and description.
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed some bugs with copy/cut and paste: when an object is not
          allowed somewhere, it's now not possible to paste it there anymore,
          and also the id of the object to be pasted is now changed until it's
          unique (in the past, a bug in creating a unique id kept the status
          of a document 'public' in some cases).
        
        - Intermediate fix where an local roles mapping for an non-existing
          userid would display "Unknown User" and could not be deleted.
        
        - Past to ghost of Publications exposed two bugs. Fixed now.
        
        0.9.1.1
        -------
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - UI bug where the cursor would behave inconsistently when hoovering
          buttons and buttonlinks.
        
        - Membership now supports member objects that have different ids than
          the userids. This is useful in LDAP setups where the userid may
          contain characters illegal in URLs, such as the @ sign.
        
        - Edit on pro transformations up to date.
        
        0.9.1
        -----
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The "use selection" button would not return to tab_access just after
          assigning a role to a user.
        
        - Changed from absolute_url(1) to getPhysicalPath() for code elements
          - this should make code elements work in a virtual host setup.
        
        - Datasource parameters store empty strings instead of None for
          default values.
        
        - Fixed bug where the title of a SQLDatasource Asset was not set in
          the edit tab.
        
        - Corrected access key in Indexer tabs.
        
        - Fixed tab_edit where Authors can't move anything and see an empty
          controls row.
        
        - Adjusted tab_edit and tab_status access key links so they work with
          Mozilla (select lists and checkbox labels).
        
        - Removed Mozilla incompatibility notes from help (since the problems
          are fixed).
        
        - Updated layout_macro to match presentation preview link in
          tab_preview.
        
        - Fixed location of closed message in tab_preview so it shows up
          regardless of which layout (public or default) gets used.  Aligned
          presentation preview link better in default layout.
        
        - Fix where the Groups administration button was shown, even if no
          service_groups was available.
        
        - Now refreshes all installed products before an
          "upgrade all" action.
        
        - Fixed bug where a new connection id was not updated correctly on the
          SQL Datasource Asset
        
        - Indexer objects now show up in public table of contents always if
          placed (before they never did).
        
        - File assets could only be added by users with manager role; this now
          only requires an Author role.
        
        - A memory leak exists in Zope 2.5.1 that is exposed by Silva in some
          cases when using the SMI. Zope 2.6.1 appears to fix this memory
          leak. Note though that while Zope 2.6.1 appears to work with Silva,
          we haven't done extensive testing...
        
        - Fixed bug which cause the upgrade of all content to crash on
          CatalogedVersionedContent objects (e.g. SilvaNews NewsItems)
        
        - Chief editors could not add Groups or Virtual groups due to
          incorrect security settings; fixed.

        - Soft breaks in paragraphs (single enter).
        
        - Small API on Silva Root (add_silva_addable_forbidden() and
          clear_silva_addables_forbidden()) for absolutely forbidding
          visibility of certain meta_types in SMI. See also IRoot.py.
        
        - Improved tab_access user interface.
        
        - Group and VirtualGroup objects. Can be managed by going to 'Group
          Administration' if Group product is installed. This makes group
          management a lot easier.
        
        - Optional message service ('service_message') which will send email
          on some workflow events.
        
        - Membership system. Different membership policies (working for
          instance with LDAP) can be plugged into Silva and enabled by placing
          a different Member Service ('service_members').
        
        - Access request system. A new UI so that users who do not have
          permissions to access a place can request roles on objects
          (optional).
        
        - New 'Data Source' is now enabled by default. The first
          implementation is an 'SQL Data Source' Asset. This can be used to
          import data from a relational database into a Document using the
          'external data' element.
        
        - List titles have been removed and transformed into headings.
        
        - 'image_path' has been renamed to 'path' in the XML.

        - Modification time of assets should now be updated properly
          (issue147).
        
        - Some characters that were removed by the Silva editor shouldn't be
          removed -- made these work (issue 176).
        
        - New ('add') button should work properly again (issue 162).
        
        - Invalid image references now properly display error message (issue
          204).

        - After deleting a finished DocmaServer job, you are redirected to an
          existing page.
        
        - The (still disabled) externaldata element was registered wrong when
          enabled; fixed this (if you uncomment the code to enable it).

        - XML can be exported and imported.
        
        - Docma integration for importing/exporting to other document formats
          (like MS Word). This feature needs the separate Docma server (not
          yet released).
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - All '__index__.py' files are now non-empty, so that WinZip actually
          unpacks them...

        - Table rendering code cleanup, better use of CSS

        - Pasted ghosts now obtain a last author.
        
        - Indexer is now addable by editor and up (used to be manager
          only). Added note in UI that indexer works for published content
          only. Also fixed a bug in the Indexer; it now also indexes 'index'
          (default) documents.
        
        - Demo index document gets automatically added to new Silva root.
        
        - 'Authorized users below this level' moved to sub screen of access,
          to make container tab_metadata scale better (this could be very slow
          on large sites).
        
        - Tweaked LDAPUserFolder.py so it works with more recent versions of
          LDAPUserFolder.

        - Created installation framework for Silva extension packages.
          'service_extensions' allows site managers to install new extension

          lists to this new XML format).
        
        - Display an informational message, if some view is not properly
          registered.
        
        - UI tweaks and fixes.

          be renamed in one go.
