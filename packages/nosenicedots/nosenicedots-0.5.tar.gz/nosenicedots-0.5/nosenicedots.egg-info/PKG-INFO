        ::
        
          $ nosetests --with-nicedots

          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          Traceback (most recent call last):

          FAIL: apps/devhub/tests/test_views.py:TestAddVersion.test_unique_version_num
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/path/to/apps/devhub/tests/test_views.py", line 3132, in test_unique_version_num

          Ran 44 tests in 1.62s
        
          FAILED (failures=1)
        
        This new style of output is intended as a more useful test report and is
        inspired by `py.test`_. Instead of a confusing (yet pretty) mess of dots
        you'll see a printout of the module or class followed by dots that indicate
        each test in that group.
        
        You'll see the traceback for a failure immediately, which was designed for
        long running test suites. Note that the tracebacks are repeated again down at
        the bottom in case the output had scrolled off the screen already. Using
        ``--stop`` will not duplicate failure output.
        
        .. _`py.test`: http://pytest.org/
        
        It's Also A Test Address
        ========================
        
        Each module or class group also doubles as an argument you can give to Nose if
        you want to re-run that group of tests. From the above output you could
        copy/paste and re-run tests in the TestActivity class like this::
        
          $ nosetests --with-nicedots apps/devhub/tests/test_views.py:TestActivity
        
          apps/devhub/tests/test_views.py:TestActivity
          ..............
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          Ran 14 tests in 0.62s
        
          OK
        
        Caveats
        =======
        
        - If any other plugin needs to patch the unittest result then it will
          conflict with Nice Dots.
        - Python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 are supported at the moment. Other versions may or
          may not work.  Python 3 is **not** yet supported.  There are a few failing
          tests.
