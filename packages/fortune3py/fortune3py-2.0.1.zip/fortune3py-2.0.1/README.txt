fortune3py
~~~~~~~~~~

This is a Python3 implementation of the fortune-mod program. It was written based on fortune-mod-1.99.1 in the
Debian repository. This package should hopefully fill in for the absence of a Windows/Python3 implementation.
fortune3py is also available on github.com (https://github.com/jbahuleyan/fortune3py).
