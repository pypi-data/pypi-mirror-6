Tourneys management
-------------------

.. index::
   pair: Management; Clubs

The *tourney* is clearly the primary element of the whole system,
everything has been designed to allow an easy and fast management of
these events.


Menu actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the :ref:`standard actions <standard actions>` the menu
at the top contains the following items:

   :figclass: float-right

   Tourneys management

:guilabel:`Details`
  Opens the :ref:`management <tourney management>` window of the
  selected tourney.

:guilabel:`Competitors`
  Opens the :ref:`competitors fixup` window that allows the correction
  of the competitors of old tourneys.

:guilabel:`Replay again`
  Allows *duplicating* an existing tourney, expecially handy on teams
  events: it basically clones a tourney on the current date, with all
  its competitors; just be sure to update the description, eventually
  adjusting the date of the event!

:guilabel:`Download`
  Downloads an archive of the selected tourney's data.


Insert and edit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   pair: Insert and edit; Tourney

Each tourney has a :guilabel:`date` and a :guilabel:`description` of
the event and there cannot be two dictinct tourneys in the same date
associated to a single championship.

The :guilabel:`location` is optional.

The :guilabel:`duration` and :guilabel:`prealarm` refer to the length
of a single turn, and are expressed in *minutes*. They will be used by
the :ref:`clock` window.

A tourney may use a particular :guilabel:`rating`: in such a case, the
first turn is generated accordingly with the rate of each player
instead of using a random order.

.. _couplings:

The :guilabel:`pairing method` determines how the couplings are done at
each new turn:

``Ranking order``
  the ``serial`` algorithm will try to couple a player with one of the
  players that follows him in the current ranking order, for example
  the first with the second, the third with the fourth, and so on;

``Dazed ranking order``
  to delay as much as possible most exciting matches, the ``dazed``
  method is more elaborated: it takes the players with same points as
  the pivot, and tries to couple the first with the one in the middle
  of that series, the second with the middle+1 one, and so on.
