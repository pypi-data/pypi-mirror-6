===================
TODO for SilvaForum
===================

* Fix the Ajax version that has collapsible forms. Add unicode support to
  hidden input fields.

* Rig the preview form to render emoticons.

* i18n the pagination strings.

* Add close a topic functionality to comments so that it remains public but no 
  more comments can be added.

* Close forums/topics to selected users.

* Incorporate the kupu editor.

* Get SilvaFind working with SilvaForum.

* Set user timezones.

* Specify a SilvaForum moderator role or assign it to an existing role. Add
  a moderate link in the frontend which connects to the corresponding 
  backend.

* Forum users can edit their 'profile', which right now means editing their
  full name an email address. This is needed because some OPs (OpenID Provider)
  have horrible and non-human readable ids, e.g. Yahoo. Right now this is the 
  same as the User Settings popup in the SMI. Presumably we'll have to change 
  this to be more conformant with a generic and customizable front end.

Issues
------

* Change the breadcrumb so it uses the format_text in view.py to
  retrieve emoticons

* Add an 'index' object to forum and topics, and build in interfaces for
  editing these views in the SMI. For the moment decided to take out the
  messages for topics.

* author registration in the smi. figured out a work around, but the real
  reason for this bug is yet to be discovered.

Known bugs
----------

* Got this error on adding some id's:

    BadRequest: The id "1_3" is invalid - it is already in use.

  However I can enter the same id more than ten times, like adding '1' fourteen
  times.
