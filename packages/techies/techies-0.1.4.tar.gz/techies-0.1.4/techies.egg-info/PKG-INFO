        Opinionated Python toolbox
        
        Master branch: |Build Status|
        
        List of Tools
        -------------
        
        ``Queue`` Implementations (backed by Redis)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. ``techies.Queue``, based on Redis List. Interfaces are almost
           standard queue compatible.
        2. ``techies.UniQueue``, based on Redis Sorted Set. Inherits
           ``techies.Queue`` but ignores repetitive items, keeps items unique.
           Score of the sorted set member is epoch timestamp from
           ``time.time()``.
        3. ``techies.CountQueue``, based on Redis Sorted Set. Inherits
           ``techies.UniQueue`` but score is used as a count of item appearance,
           that the item has the highest count gets placed in front to be
           ``get`` first.
        
        ``logging.Handler`` Implementation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. ``techies.QueueHandler``, inherits standard ``logging.Handler`` that
           ``emit`` to any standard ``Queue`` compatible implementations,
           including all the ``Queue`` implementations in this library.
        
        Misc Tools
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. ``techies.StateCounter``, based on Redis Hash. To see an example of
           its usage, see
           ```tidehunter`` <https://github.com/woozyking/tidehunter#example-2-without-limit>`__.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        -  Redis server for ``Queue`` implementations and ``StateCounter``.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install techies

            q.put('dota')
            q.put('skyrim')
            q.put('dota')
        
            # Check size of the queue, two ways
            print(q.qsize())  # 4
            print(len(q))  # 4
        
            # get, or dequeue

            q.put('dota')
            q.put('skyrim')
            q.put('dota')  # increment the count of the existing 'dota'
        
            # Check size of the unique queue, two ways
            print(q.qsize())  # 3
            print(len(q))  # 3
        
            # get, or dequeue
            print(q.get())  # ('dota', 2)  # the one with the most count is returned first

            q.clear()
        
        ``QueueHandler``

                        logger.error(e)

        -----------------
        
        To run unit tests locally, make sure that you have Redis server
        installed and running
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            $ pip install -r test_requirements.txt

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.1.4 (2014-01-22)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Added ``StateCounter``, a state counter based on Redis ``Hash``. To
           see an example of its usage, see
           ```tidehunter`` <https://github.com/woozyking/tidehunter#example-2-without-limit>`__.
        -  Included ``hiredis`` in requirements.txt for added performance gain.
        
        0.1.3 (2014-01-20)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Added ``QueueHandler``, inherits standard ``logging.Handler`` that
           ``emit`` to any standard ``Queue`` compatible implementations,
           including all the ``Queue`` implementations in this library
        -  Exposed direct accessibility of all intended APIs, for example,
           ``from techies import Queue``; or if you will,
           ``from techies import *``
        -  Behavior of ``CountQueue.get`` has changed from just returning the
           item value to a ``tuple`` of item value and its number of appearances
           in the queue, eg: ``('dota', 2)``; an empty ``tuple`` is returned
           when the ``CountQueue`` is empty
        
        0.1.2 (2014-01-17)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Added ``CountQueue``, inherits ``UniQueue`` but the score is used as
           a count of item appearance, that the item has the highest count gets
           placed in front to be ``get`` first
        -  Behavior of all ``Queue`` and its subclasses' ``put`` and
           ``put_nowait`` methods changed from return certain value to not
           return anything (more Python standard Queue like)
        
        0.1.1 (2014-01-16)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Python 3.2 and 3.3 supported now
        -  Behavior of both ``Queue`` and ``UniQueue``'s ``get`` method changed
           from returning ``None`` to empty "native string" (unicode for Python
           2.x, str for Python 3.x) when attempting to dequeue from an empty
           queue
        
        0.1.0 (2014-01-16)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Initial release with Redis backed ``Queue`` and ``UniQueue``
