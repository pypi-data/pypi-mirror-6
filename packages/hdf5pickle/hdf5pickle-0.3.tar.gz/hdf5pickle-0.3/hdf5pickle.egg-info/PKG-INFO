Description: 
        Create easily interfaceable representations of Python objects in HDF5
        files. The aim of this module is to provide both
        
            (1) convenient Python object persistence
            (2) compatibility with non-Python applications
        
        Point 2 is useful, for example, if results from numerical
        calculations should be easily transferable for example to a non-Python
        visualization program. For example, if program state is serialized to
        a HDF5 file, it can easily be examined with for example Octave_.
