BastionLedger - Accounts

   Description

      This shows all of the accounts in the ledger and their balances - it is
      effectively the trial balance for the ledger.

      The *Accounts* folder is also a ZCatalog - allowing for a sophisticated
      range of queries to be applied to the folder in order to group and 
      summarise account information.
