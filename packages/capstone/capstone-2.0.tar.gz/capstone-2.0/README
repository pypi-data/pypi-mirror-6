Capstone is a disassembly framework with the target of becoming the ultimate
disasm engine for binary analysis and reversing in the security community.

Created by Nguyen Anh Quynh, then developed and maintained by a small community,
Capstone offers some unparalleled features:

- Support multiple hardware architectures: ARM, ARM64 (ARMv8), Mips, PPC & X86.

- Having clean/simple/lightweight/intuitive architecture-neutral API.

- Provide details on disassembled instruction (called “decomposer” by others).

- Provide semantics of the disassembled instruction, such as list of implicit
     registers read & written.

- Implemented in pure C language, with lightweight wrappers for C++, Python,
     Ruby, OCaml, C#, Java and Go available.

- Native support for Windows & *nix platforms (with OSX, Linux, *BSD & Solaris
  have been confirmed).

- Thread-safe by design.

- Distributed under the open source BSD license.
