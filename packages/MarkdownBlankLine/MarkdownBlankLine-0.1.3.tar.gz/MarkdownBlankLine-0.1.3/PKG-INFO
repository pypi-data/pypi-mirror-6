        ==================
        
        Blank line extension for Markdown.
        
        This extension adds the syntax for an user to add a blank line. This can be in the middle of a text block. 
        Just type %% and it will add a <br>. This is especially useful for adding blank lines on their own.
        
        This might create unforeseen <br>'s  with the nl2br extension. As you will get double new lines.
