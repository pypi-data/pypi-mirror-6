Description: OpenStack Doc Tools
        *******************
        
        This repository contains tools used by the OpenStack Documentation
        project.
        
        For more details, see the `OpenStack Documentation wiki page
        <http://wiki.openstack.org/Documentation>`_.
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        `Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`_ must be installed to build the
        documentation.
        
        To install Maven 3 for Ubuntu 12.04 and later, and Debian wheezy and later::
        
            apt-get install maven
        
        On Fedora::
        
            yum install maven3
        
        This package needs a few external dependencies including lxml. If you
        do not have lxml installed, you can either install python-lxml or have
        it installed automatically and build from sources. To build lxml from
        sources, you need a C compiler and the xml and xslt development
        packages installed.
        
        To install python-lxml, execute the following based on your
        distribution.
        
        On Fedora::
        
            yum install python-lxml
        
        On openSUSE::
        
            zypper in python-lxml
        
        On Ubuntu::
        
            apt-get install python-lxml
        
        For building from source,  install the dependencies of lxml.
        
        On openSUSE::
        
            zypper in libxslt-devel
        
        On Ubuntu::
        
            apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
        
        
        Updating RNG schema files
        =========================
        
        The repository contains in the directory ``os_doc_tools/resources`` a
        local copy of some RNG schema files so that they do not need to be
        downloaded each time for validation of XML and WADL files.
        
        Please see the ``README.txt`` in the directory for details on where
        these files come from.

        0.5

         * Test that resources in wadl files have an xml:id (lp:bug 1275007).
         * Improve formatting of python command line clients (lp:bug 1274699).
         * Copy all generated books to directory publish-docs in the git
           top-level (lp:blueprint draft-docs-on-docs-draft).
         * Requires now a config file in top-level git directory named
           doc-test.conf.
         * Allow building of translated manuals, these need to be setup first
           with "generatedocbook -l LANGUAGE -b BOOK".

        Contributing
        ============
        Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud computing,
        and encourages you to join the `OpenStack Foundation <http://www.openstack.org/join>`_.
        The best way to get involved with the community is to talk with others online
        or at a meetup and offer contributions through our processes, the `OpenStack
        wiki <http://wiki.openstack.org>`_, blogs, or on IRC at ``#openstack``
        on ``irc.freenode.net``.
        
        We welcome all types of contributions, from blueprint designs to documentation
        to testing to deployment scripts.
        
        If you would like to contribute to the development,
        you must follow the steps in the "If you're a developer, start here"
        section of this page:
        
           http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute
        
        Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
        should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
        the workflow documented at:
        
           http://wiki.openstack.org/GerritWorkflow
        
        Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.
        
        Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:
        
           https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals
