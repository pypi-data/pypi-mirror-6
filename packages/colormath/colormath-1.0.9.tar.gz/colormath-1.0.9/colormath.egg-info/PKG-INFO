Description: Python Color Math Module (colormath)
        ====================================

        What is it?
        -----------
        
        This module implements a large number of different color operations such as
        color space conversions, Delta E, and density to spectral.
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        Public documentation for color math is very limited, and there were no Python
        color math libraries with even a fraction of the common routines implemented.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        colormath requires NumPy, which you may get from:
         
            http://numpy.scipy.org/
        
        Or via pip/easy_install::
        
            pip install numpy
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install colormath is via pip/easy_install::
        
            pip install colormath
        
        Alternatively, download and extract the package from PyPi at
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colormath/, then extract and run the installer
        directly::
        
          python setup.py install
          
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        For documentation, see the project webpage at:
        
            http://code.google.com/p/python-colormath/
            
        There are also a lot of useful examples under the examples directory within
        this directory.
