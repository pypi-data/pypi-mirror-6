genetic_models.py

Genetic models take a family object with individuals and variants and annotates for each variant which models they follow in this family.

The following models are checked:

- Autosomal Dominant(AD)
- Autosomal Dominant De Novo(AD_DN)
- Autosomal Recessive(AR)
- Autosomal Recessive De Novo(AR_DN)
- Autosomal Recesive Compound.

In this model a variant must imply affected status, otherwise it can not be dominant. All sick has to be ay least heterozygote for the variant and all healthy can not have it.

We will assume that each individual that we have information about is present among the individual in self.family.individuals.


is the individual sick?

    - If the individual is homozygote alternative then AD/AD-denovo and AR/AR-denovo are ok

    - If the individual is is heterozygote then AD/AD-denovo are ok but AR/AR-denovo are not ok

    - If the individual is homozygote reference no model is ok

    - If the individual has no call all models are ok



is the individual healthy?

    - If the individual is homozygote alternative then no model is ok

    - If the individual is heterozygote then AR/AR-denove are ok but AD/AD-denovo are not ok

    - If the individual is homozygote referense all models are ok

    - If there is no call all models are ok



is there no known phenotype?

    - All models are ok for all variants
