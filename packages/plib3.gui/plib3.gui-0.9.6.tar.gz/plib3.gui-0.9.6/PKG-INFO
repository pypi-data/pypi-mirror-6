Description: The PLIB3.GUI package contains a simple GUI application framework
        with two main features:
        
        - It lets the same high-level code work with a number of
          different underlying GUI toolkits. Currently supported:
          Qt 4, PySide, KDE 4, and wxPython. (The original reason
          for writing this sub-package was that wxWidgets doesn't
          use Qt and I like the Qt/KDE widgets better, but Qt was
          not available for Windows and I wanted code that would
          run cross-platform.) Note that the KDE 4 and wxPython
          toolkits are untested at this time.
        
        - It allows you to express the layout of your GUI in terms
          of Python lists and dicts, enabling a much more declarative
          and easy to read (and maintain) coding style.
        
        Other than selecting the toolkit (which may not be necessary:
        the main module of the sub-package can 'auto-detect' which
        toolkit to use--the ``plib-setup-gui`` post-install script
        does most of the work to enable this--so you only need to
        override if you don't like the default), you should not have
        to worry about any toolkit internal details; the goal of this
        sub-package is to make them all look the same to your code.
        
        Note: PLIB3.GUI works with Python 3. If you are using Python
        2.7, see the PLIB.GUI package, available at
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plib.gui.
        
        The ``setup.py`` script for PLIB3.GUI uses the ``setuputils``
        helper module, which helps to automate away much of the
        boilerplate in Python setup scripts. This module is available
        as a separate release at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuputils3.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install PLIB3.GUI, you can simply run::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        at a shell prompt from the directory into which you
        unzipped the source tarball (the same directory that this
        README file is in). This will install PLIB3 and then
        run each of the post-install scripts in the scripts
        directory.
        
        Example Programs
        ----------------
        
        PLIB3.GUI comes with example programs that illustrate key features
        of the package. After installation, these can be found in the
        ``$PREFIX/share/plib/examples`` directory. If you have a
        POSIX system (Linux or Mac OSX), the ``plib-setup-examples``
        post-install script will install symlinks to the example
        programs in the ``$PREFIX/bin`` directory.
