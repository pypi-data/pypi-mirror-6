Description: hunk
        ====
        
        Helps client-side Web development by mocking JSON API server.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        hunk can be installed via pip or easy_install:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install hunk
        
        Or:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ easy_install hunk
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Setup data directory and files. 
        
        - Directories under the root have a HTTP method name
        - Directories and files have name to be resource path
        - Files have conent to be response JSON
        
        For example:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ tree demo/simple/
            demo/simple/
            |-- get
            |   |-- members
            |   |   |-- 100.json
            |   |   |-- 200.json
            |   |   |-- 300.json
            |   |   ...
            |   +-- sounds.json
            |-- post
            |   +-- members.json
            ...
        
        Move to the root directory and run hunk:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ cd demo/simple/
            $ hunk
             * Running on http://localhost:8080/
        
        Now, you can access Web API with HTTP:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $  curl http://localhost:8080/members/100
            {"gender": "female", "kind": "human", "name": "Dorothy"}
        
            $ curl http://localhost:8080/members
            [{"kind": "scarecrow", "name": "Hunk"}, ...]
        
            $ curl http://localhost:8080/sounds
            [{"title": "Over The Rainbow"}, ... ]
        
            $ curl http://localhost:8080/members -X POST
            {"result": "success"}
