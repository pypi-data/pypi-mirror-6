Things that need to be done
---------------------------

- When encoding text, make sure everything is encoded (nothing is left
  over), and deal with errors.

- Make it possible for a user to override the use of the GUI editor
  with a preference setting, possibly allowing a different editor to
  be plugged in.

- Fetch FCKeditor separately instead of including it in the
  zope.html checkout.

- Add support for FCKeditor plugins; it would be cool to have the
  full-screen editor from here:

    http://www.saulmade.nl/FCKeditor/FCKPlugins.php

- Better widgets, with less haphazard configurability.  There should
  really be display widgets as well.
