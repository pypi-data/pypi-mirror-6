Description: 
        I got tired of not having a good cross-platform module for accessing the clipboard in Python, so I put this together. 
        It is a module that loads a copy() and paste() function depending on what your operating system (or window manager) is.
        
        It has the following requirements:
            Windows - No requirements. You donÂ’t need the win32 module installed.
            Mac - Requires the pbcopy and pbpaste, which come with OS X.
            Linux - Requires the xclip command, which possibly comes with the os. If not, run sudo apt-get install xclip. Or have the gtk or PyQt4 modules installed.
            Pyperclip runs on both Python 2 and Python 3.
        
        Usage is simple:
            import pyperclip
            pyperclip.copy('The text to be copied to the clipboard.')
            spam = pyperclip.paste()
        
        
        Change Log:
        1.2 Use the platform module to help determine OS.
        1.3 Changed ctypes.windll.user32.OpenClipboard(None) to ctypes.windll.user32.OpenClipboard(0), after some people ran into some TypeError
