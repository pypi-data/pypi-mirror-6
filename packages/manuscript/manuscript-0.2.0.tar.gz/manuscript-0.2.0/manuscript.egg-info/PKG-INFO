        Manuscript helps you manage your python scripts and their dependencies
        
        Python still is a scripting language, and it is awesome for
        this. Moreover, we now have some great libraries that make writing
        scripts even easier, like requests, docopt or pathlib. However, having
        to install them system-wide, or start worrying about virtualenv for
        just one script is annoying. Manuscript is here to help you handle that.
        
        Just add a line of the form ``#deps: requests docopt pathlib`` to your script,
        and manuscript will install them in a virtualenv and create a wrapper for you.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        You can get it on `pypi`_ with the usual ``pip install manuscript``.
        
        You can also install manuscript using manuscript! For this, use this line get manuscript and its dependencies, and use manuscript to install itself::
        
            cd /tmp && wget https://bitbucket.org/pitrou/pathlib/raw/e39c980b59a9705fe60f24e36cb202771af88256/pathlib.py https://raw.github.com/docopt/docopt/0.6.1/docopt.py https://raw.github.com/madjar/manuscript/master/manuscript.py && python3 manuscript.py install -c manuscript.py
        
        Once it's done, I recommend you add ``~/.manuscript/bin/`` to your path, to make it easier to access installed scripts.
        
        Manuscript requires python 3.
        
        .. _`pypi`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/manuscript
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You just wrote ``some_awesome_script.py`` that uses ``requests`` and ``docopt``, and you want to use it on your system without worrying about the dependencies. Just add this line somewhere in your script::
        
          #deps requests docopt
        
        Then run manuscript::
        
          manuscript install some_awesome_script.py
        
        This will install all the dependencies in a virtualenv and create a wrapper around the script as ``~/.manuscript/bin/some_awesome_script``.
        
        The virtualenv will use the interpreter mentioned in the script's shebang, falling back to ``python`` if none is found. You can force an interpreter with the ``-i`` option, like so::
        
          manuscript install some_awesome_script.py -i pypy
        
        If you don't want a script to share the default virtualenv with other scripts, you can specify a virtualenv name in which to install the script's dependencies (it will be created if needed)::
        
          manuscript install some_awesome_script.py -e awesome-venv
        
        If you want to reuse an env created by virtualenv-wrapper, you can pass ``workon:NAME`` as the environment name. Manuscript will use the ``WORKON_HOME`` environment variable to find it. If it does not exist, manuscript will not create it.
        
        If you edit you script to add more dependencies, just run::
        
          manuscript check-deps
        
        This will install all missing dependencies for all the scripts.
        
        
        Finally, if you want to use manuscript on a script that won't last (something downloaded from the internet that sits on your ``/tmp`` for example), just add the `-c` argument: manuscript will first copy the script to a safe place, then do the whole dance.
