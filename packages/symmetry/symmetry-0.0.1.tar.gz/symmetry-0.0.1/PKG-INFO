Description: 
        Welcome to the repo for NANO106.
        
        NANO106 is UCSD's course on Crystallography of Materials taught by Prof Shyue
        Ping Ong. The purpose of this repo is to serve as a persistent and evolving
        collection of supplementary course materials that illustrate various symmetry
        and crystallography concepts and computations. Most of the code are written in
        python and presented in ipython notebooks. Some static material may be created
        in LaTeX.
        
        While this repo is completely open and anyone is welcome to use the materials
        contain therein, I would ask that you acknowledge any usage.
        
        ## Usage
        
        To fully make use of this repo, it is recommended that you clone and install
        the symmetry package included, as well as ipython, numpy, sympy,
        and for some more specific materials analysis, [pymatgen](http://www.pymatgen.org).
        
        However, you can explore a lot of the materials without any installation.
        
        ### Viewing the Notebooks
        
        You can explore the notebooks using the excellent online ipython notebook viewer. 
        To begin, go to this [link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/materialsvirtuallab/nano106/tree/master/lectures/)
        which points to the root lectures directory.
        
        ## Acknowledgemnents
        
        Nano106 uses the following textbooks and much of the code and material
        contain therein is based on concepts in these books. They are highly
        recommended for students of crystallography, symmetry and its implications
        for material properties.
