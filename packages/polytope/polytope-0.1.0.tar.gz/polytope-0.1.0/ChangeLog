Polytope package update history
===============================

==== version 0.1.0 - 27 April 2014 ====

This initial release has very few changes since its break from TuLiP,
and is primarily intended to provide a reference version that easily integrates
with legacy code developed assuming polytope is a part of TuLiP.
