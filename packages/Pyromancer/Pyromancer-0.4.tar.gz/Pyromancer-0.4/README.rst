Simple framework for creating IRC bots.

Example
~~~~~~~

init.py:

.. code:: python

    from pyromancer.objects import Pyromancer

    p = Pyromancer('test.settings')
    p.run()

test/settings.py:

.. code:: python

    host = '1.2.3.4'
    port = 6667
    nick = 'PyromancerBot'
    encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'

Custom commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing own commands is fairly simple. Create a folder which will be the
package name, with a file named ``commands.py`` in it to hold the
commands. In ``commands.py``, you can register functions to be a command
with the built-in command decorator.

Example
^^^^^^^

File layout:

::

    test/
        __init__.py
        commands.py
        settings.py
    init.py

commands.py:

.. code:: python

    from pyromancer.decorators import command


    @command(r'bye (.*)')
    def bye(match):
        return 'Bye {m[1]}!'

On IRC:

::

    <User> !bye everyone
    <Bot> Bye everyone!

Pyromancer scans automatically for functions decorated using the
commands decorator, so all your commands in ``commands.py`` are used
automatically.

You can also create a directory named ``commands`` with submodules
containing the commands. Just make sure that you import either the
modules or all of the commands in the ``__init__.py`` file.

The ``command`` decorator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You must apply this to a function to mark it as a command. It will be
used when scanning for and collecting commands.

Parameters
''''''''''

-  ``patterns`` - a regular expression or a list of expressions. When a
   list is given, all patterns are attempted when matching the input,
   and only when all patterns in the list fail to match, the command is
   not executed.

   .. code:: python

       @command(['hi', 'hello'])
       def hi(match):
           return 'Hello!'

-  ``prefix`` - a boolean which defaults to ``True``. When true, the
   command pattern is only attempted to match when the message line
   starts with the prefix defined in the settings of the bot. This is
   useful for commands which are very bot-like (in contrary to commands
   which look and behave like natural language). Using a boolean and a
   setting allows the same command to be triggered in different ways,
   depending on the settings of the bot which installed the command
   package.

-  ``raw`` - a boolean which defaults to ``False``. When true, the raw
   input line sent from the server is used for matching the pattern,
   instead of the message. Useful for matching lines which are not a
   message from an user, such as nick or topic changes.

Messaging from a command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Messaging from inside the function which makes up the command is as easy
as can be for simple use cases, but can be done in numerous ways for the
more complex situations.

Most of the times, arguments are passed to the ``Match.msg`` function,
which applies formatting by default and provides some additional
utilities. The most important of those is that when no target has been
passed on as an argument, it will use either the channel or the user (in
case of a PM) whose input line triggered the command to be executed as
the target, effectively replying.

Parameters
''''''''''

-  ``message`` - the message to be send to the server. Formatting will
   be applied using any additional ``args`` and ``kwargs``, so you can
   apply the full power of the `Python Format
   Mini-Language <http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax>`__
   on the message.

-  ``args`` and ``kwargs`` - arguments to be passed on through the
   formatting which is applied on ``message``.

Methods of messaging
''''''''''''''''''''

-  Return a ``message``

   .. code:: python

       @command(r'bye (.*)')
       def bye(match):
           return 'Bye {m[1]}!'

-  Return a tuple of ``message`` and optional ``args`` and ``kwargs`` to
   be used when formatting ``message``. ``args`` can be both a list of
   arguments, or simply all the middle elements of the tuple.

   .. code:: python

       def gibberish(match):
           return 'A = {}, B = {}, C = {c_char}', 'a', 'b', {'c_char': 'c'}

-  Yield a ``message`` or a tuple of ``message`` and optional ``args``
   and ``kwargs``. Yielding can be done as much as you want, which is
   the easiest way of sending multiple messages from one command.

   .. code:: python

       @command(r'say (.*)')
       def say(match):
           for part in match[1].split(', '):
               yield 'Saying {}', part

-  Return a list of ``message`` or a tuple of ``message`` and optional
   ``args`` and ``kwargs``.

   .. code:: python

       def hi(match):
           return ['Hi', 'Hello']

-  Use ``Match.msg``. This is the only way to benefit from the
   non-default functionalities provided by this function.

   .. code:: python

       def raw(match):
           match.msg('Raw {} message {m[1]}', raw=True)

Extra parameters for ``Match.msg``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  ``target`` - the target to send the message to. If not provided, it
   will attempt to use either the channel or user whose input line
   triggered the command, which effectively results in replying.

-  ``raw`` - defaults to ``False``. When true, no formatting is applied
   on ``message``.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `irc <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/irc>`__

Support
~~~~~~~

Python 2.7 and 3.0 - 3.4 are supported. Note that development occurs on
Python 3.

To do
~~~~~

-  Figure out how to do translation of messages through the
   ``Match.msg`` function.
-  Add timers
-  Add a command module which keeps track of channels joined and users
   in them which other commands can use.
