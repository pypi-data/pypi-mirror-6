FAQ
===

Q1: Is there a way to use this module with perl?
A1: Yes, I do this myself. Install the python package as you normally would 
and import it into perl with Inline.pm and Inline::Python from CPAN.

Q2: When I use find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2"), I'm getting all 
interfaces beginning with 3/2, including 3/21, 3/22, 3/23 and 3/24. How can I 
limit my results?
A2. There are two ways... the simplest is to use the 'exactmatch' option... 
find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2", exactmatch=True). Another way is 
to utilize regex expansion that is native to many methods... 
find_children("interface GigabitEthernet3/2$")
