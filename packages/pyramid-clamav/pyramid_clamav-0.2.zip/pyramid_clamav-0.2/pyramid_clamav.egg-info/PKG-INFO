Description: pyramid_clamav
        ==============
        
        Pyramid tween which checks file uploads for viruses using clamav.
        
        You need to have a running clamav installation on your system to which
        the tween can connect via a unix socket. You can set the socket path in
        your config, but the defaults should work on most systems.
        
        If a virus was found, the file is removed from the request. The field which
        was used to upload the file should handle it like no file was uploaded.
        
        A flashmessage is presented to the user stating that a file contained a virus
        and it has been removed.
        
        It should also work for multiple files.
