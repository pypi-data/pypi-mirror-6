        Warning:
        ~~~~~~~~
        The confirmation of a payment order does _not_ create accounting entries, it just 
        records the fact that you gave your payment order to your bank. The booking of 
        your order must be encoded as usual through a bank statement. Indeed, it's only 
        when you get the confirmation from your bank that your order has been accepted 
        that you can book it in your accounting. To help you with that operation, you 
        have a new option to import payment orders as bank statement lines.
