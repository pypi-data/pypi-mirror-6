        Pypore
        =======
        
        This project is for translocation event finding/analysis.
        It's written in Python, with `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_/`scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ as a Matlab replacement.
        The gui library is `pyside <http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide>`_, and `pyqtgraph <http://www.pyqtgraph.org/>`_ is used for plotting.
        More information can be found `here <http://parkin.github.io/pypore>`_.
        
        **Note** that Pypore/PyporeGui are pre-alpha, major changes can happen at any time.
        
        Pull requests are welcome!
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Dependencies
        ++++++++++++
        
        Pypore has the following dependencies:
        
        * numpy
        * scipy
        * PyTables
        
        PyporeGui depends on all of the above and:
        
        * PySide
        * pyqtgraph
        
        Building from source additionally requires:
        
        * Cython
        
        Running the tests requires:
        
        * nose
        
        Installing with pip
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            pip install pypore
            
        Installing from source
        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        Clone or download the source. In the directory (with setup.py), run one of the following:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            python setup.py install
            
        or
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            pip install .
            
        Running the tests:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            python setup.py tests
            
        PyporeGui
        =========
        
        Start PyporeGui with:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import pyporegui
            pyporegui.start()
