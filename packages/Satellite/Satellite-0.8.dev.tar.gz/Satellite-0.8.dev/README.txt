Welcome !
Satellite allows to visualize a TLP data from a quite large number
of TLP setups: Oryx, Barth, HANWA, HPPI, LAAS, SERMA. Basically,
it allows to compare TLP IVs, visualize a TLP IV curve with its leakage
evolution, to select and visualize transient current and voltage associated
to a  TLP point and visualize the leakage IVs.
Satellite is based on thunderstorm library.
Satellite is under MIT license.
