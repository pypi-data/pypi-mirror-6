        ============
        
        SlickLogTail is a Python tool which works like the tail unix command.
        It reads the appended data to a log file and transfers it to the SlickLog.com platform.
        SlickLogTail is able to detect if a log file is rotated, in that case it starts reading
        the data from the new rotated log file.
        See `SlickLog Developers Documentation <http://slicklog.com/documentation>`_
        for more info.
