lead: Jon, a kindred spirit.

Tyrion accompanies King Robert Baratheon's party to Winterfell, but after weeks on the road he leaves the party and rides ahead to seek the pleasures of the winter town's brothels, where he makes the acquaintance of Ros. 

He gives the prostitute a Lannister lion necklace to thank her for their time together.

Jaime convinces him to join the family for dinner. Tyrion dawdles outside the feast hall, reluctant to make nice with the Starks and his own family, and as a result meets Jon Snow, Lord Eddard Stark's bastard son. 

He realises that Jon is something of a kindred spirit: "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."
