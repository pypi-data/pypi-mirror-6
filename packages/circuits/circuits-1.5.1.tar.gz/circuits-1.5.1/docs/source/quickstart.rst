Quick Start Guide
=================

The easiest way to download and install circuits is to use the
`setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ easy_install tool:

.. code-block:: sh
   
   $ easy_install circuits
   

Now that you have successfully downloaded and installed circuits, let's
test that circuits is properly installed and working.

First, let's check the installed version:

.. code-block:: python
   
   >>> import circuits
   >>> print circuits.__version__
   1.3
   
Try some of the examples in the examples/ directory shipped with the
distribution or have a look at some of the :doc:`Examples <examples>`
in this documentation.

Have fun :)
