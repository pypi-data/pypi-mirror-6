        Overview
        --------
        
        ``jaraco.video`` implements a framegrabber inteface for Windows Video Capture
        devices.
        
        Status and License
        ------------------
        
        ``jaraco.video`` is a port of the `VideoCapture module
        <http://videocapture.sourceforge.net/>`_ in pure Python using ctypes
        and comtypes.
        
        ``jaraco.video`` is maintained by Jason R. Coombs.  It is licensed under
        an `MIT-style permissive license
        <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.
        
        You can install it with ``easy_install jaraco.video``, or from the
        `mercurial repository
        <http://bitbucket.org/jaraco/jaraco.video/get/tip.zip#egg=jaraco.video-dev>`_
        with
        ``easy_install jaraco.video==dev``.
        
        `jaraco.video` is designed to run on Python 2.6+, including Python 3,
        and including 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Python.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``jaraco.video`` depends on several libraries including Pillow and comtypes.
        If the package is installed using `setuptools
        <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools>`_ or `pip
        <https://pythonhosted.org/pip>`_, those dependencies should be installed
        automatically.
        
        There are `some <https://sourceforge.net/p/comtypes/bugs/27/>`_
        `issues <https://sourceforge.net/p/comtypes/bugs/30/>`_ that prevent the
        released version of comtypes from installing properly. Until those issues are
        fixed, work around them by first installing comtypes manually from jaraco's
        mirror::
        
            easy_install https://bitbucket.org/jaraco/comtypes/get/b85ebb181c17.zip
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ``jaraco.video`` includes a console script "save-frame", which
        locates the first video capture device and saves a single frame
        to disk as "test.jpg". The command may also be invoked thus::
        
            python -m jaraco.video.capture
        
        This example usage can be seen in the function
        ``jaraco.video.capture:save_frame``.
        
        History
        -------
        
        1.2.1
        ~~~~~
        
        * Fixed several errors in the code due to untested refactorings for Python 3
          support. The code now runs properly under Python 3.
        * #3: Added notes about deploying the latest version of comtypes with bug
          fixes from jaraco's mirror.
        
        1.2
        ~~~
        
        * #1: Require jaraco.util for bitutil, which has progressed with better Python
          3 support.
        * #2: Added a hard dependency on Pillow for imaging. The library is pretty
          useless without it. If there is a use-case out there for using the library
          without Pillow, please file a request ticket.
        
        1.1
        ~~~
        
        * Moved typelibs so they will be included with the build.
        * Fixed ImportError on Python 3.
        * Added readme.
        
        1.0
        ~~~
        
        * First non-dev release. Typelibs are included and comtypes libs are
          generated automatically.
