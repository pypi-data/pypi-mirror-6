        ========
        
        Daemond that monitor services and acts on them based on rules
        
        
        The project resides mainly in two commands, the monitor and the actions executor.
        The monitor is a loop that retrieves from the DB the info about the MonitoredServices.
        
        Each MonitoredService is the relation of:
        
            - A metric.
            - A condition for that metric
            - A time the condition must be True
            - An action must be triggered if the condition was True more seconds than the 
            shown by the threshold.
            
        When an action is triggered, its queued in a Redis list.
        
        The Action Executor is a daemon that collects the actions queued at the Redis list 
        and executes them.
