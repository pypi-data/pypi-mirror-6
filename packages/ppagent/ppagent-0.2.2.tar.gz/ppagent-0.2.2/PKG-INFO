Description: PowerPool Agent
        ===============
        A statistics collection agent for the PowerPool mining server. It was built to
        work with `Simple Doge mining pool <http://simpledoge.com>`_ . Currently only
        available for linux distributions running python 2.6 or 2.7. Tested on cgminer
        3.7.2 and sgminer 4.1.0, may work for other cgminer derivatives.
        
        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Make sure your cgminer or sgminer is running with the api port enabled. This
        can be done on command line with the ``--api-listen`` argument, or in your
        configuration file with ``"api-listen": true``.
        
        Ubuntu:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            sudo pip install ppagent
            sudo ppagent install upstart
            
        Debian (for BAMT or SMOS):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            sudo pip install ppagent
            sudo ppagent install sysv
            
        Now when your miner is running against stratum.simpledoge.com the daemon will
        automatically start sending statistics to the server as well. Check your stats
        page on SimpleDoge to see that it's working. You should see something similar
        to this:
        
        .. image:: https://github.com/icook/ppagent/raw/master/doc/worker_stat.png

            :height: 153
            :align: center
        
        
        Upgrade
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Ubuntu:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            sudo pip install --upgrade ppagent
            sudo service ppagent restart
            
        Debian (for BAMT or SMOS):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            sudo pip install --upgrade ppagent
            sudo /etc/init.d/ppagent stop
            sudo /etc/init.d/ppagent start
            
        Troubleshooting
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        If it's not showing up after a minute or two you should first check the logs.
        On debian these are at:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            /var/log/ppagent.log
            
        On Ubuntu:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            /var/log/upstart/ppagent.log
            
        The error messages should give you a clue why it's not working.
        If not, login to the `simple doge IRC <https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#simpledoge>`_
        and we'll try to help you get is straightened out.
