Provides the script ncdistributer.py that will package up a python script together with any non-standard libraries into a zip file
that can be executed on a computer with a python interpreter installed.

It is similar to tools such as pyzzer, but aims to be even more straight-forward to use.

Unlike projects such as Cython and Nuitka, the this aim of this tool is not to distribute a binary file, but to distribute 
a python package that will work on standard installations of python.

Usage
=====

ncdistributer.py <filenames>...



This is currently an alpha release.  Feedback to nicholas.cole@gmail.com is
welcome.
