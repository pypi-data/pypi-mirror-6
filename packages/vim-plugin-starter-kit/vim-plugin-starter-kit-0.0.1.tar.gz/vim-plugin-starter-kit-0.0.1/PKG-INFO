        ## Get productive a little faster
        
        I created the vim-plugin-starter-kit to help speed up development and perhaps shorten the learning curve
        involved with writing Vim plugins.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install vim-plugin-starter-kit`
        
        ## Usage
        
        Run `vim-plugin-starter-kit` from the command line. Once you answer a few questions you will have all
        that you need to immediately get started writing a new Vim plugin with the Python language. The
        resulting directory will contain scaffolding for documentation, testing, and your .py and .vim files
        customized for your specified project name. The files will contain working examples you can use as
        reference as you begin writing your plugin.
        
        ## Wiki
        
        As you're are getting started check out the [Wiki] (https://github.com/JarrodCTaylor/vim-plugin-starter-kit/wiki)
        for more examples of usage of common interactions between Python scripts with the Vim buffer.
        
        ## But Wait There Is More
        
        Ever wonder how to get started writing your own vim plugin? I gave a talk where
        I use the starter-kit and walk through step by step writing and testing a
        complete plugin. Check it out [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMAeYp8mX_M)
