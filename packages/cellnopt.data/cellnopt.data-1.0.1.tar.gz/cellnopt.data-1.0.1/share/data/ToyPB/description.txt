This network is used in the reference below. It was generated manually based on the network contained in Saez-Rodriguez et al. (2011).
This network is designed to output a variety of dynamics (oscillations, transience etc.) to test all CNOR formalisms.

The data was generated using CNORode with a model including a missing link from the PKN (traf2 -> akt).

.. note:: The directory contains a SIF file named ToyModelPB.sif but also a
    PKN-ToyPB_shuffled.sif that has exactly the same topology. However, this second
    file has a different arrangements of reactions. When compressed and expanded, 
    the resulting  models are different. This is a known bug and these 2 files can 
    be used to debug that issue. The file MD-ToyPB_2timePoints.csv is a subset of 
    ToyModelPB.csv that contains the time points 0, 10 and 30 seconds only.
