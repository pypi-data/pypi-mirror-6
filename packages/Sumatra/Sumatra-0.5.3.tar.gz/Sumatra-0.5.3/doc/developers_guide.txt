Developers' guide
=================

These instructions are for developing on a Unix-like platform, e.g. Linux or
Mac OS X, with the bash shell.


Requirements
------------

    * Python_ 2.6 and/or 2.7
    * Django_ >= 1.2
    * django-tagging_ >= 0.3
    * nose_ >= 0.11.4
    * if using Python 2.6, unittest2_ >= 0.5.1
    * Distribute_ >= 0.6.14
    * (optional) mpi4py_ >= 1.2.2
    * (optional) twill_ >= 0.9 (for testing web interface)
    * (optional) coverage_ >= 3.3.1 (for measuring test coverage)
    
.. can setup.py install all these?

We strongly recommend developing within a virtualenv_.

Getting the source code
-----------------------

We use the Mercurial version control system. To get a copy of the code::

    $ cd /some/directory
    $ hg clone https://neuralensemble.org/hg/sumatra sumatra_src

If you get an ``SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE`` error, you can either use the
:option:`--insecure` option to :command:`hg clone`, or add the following lines
to your :file:`~/.hgrc` file::

  [hostfingerprints]
  neuralensemble.org = 7c:a8:72:19:79:b2:ec:d8:27:59:34:dc:a3:13:d9:5e:c3:aa:53:0e

.. note:: an alternative is to fork the `Sumatra mirror on Bitbucket`_, then
          clone your own fork.

Now you need to make sure that the ``sumatra`` package is on your PYTHONPATH and
that the ``smt`` and ``smtweb`` scripts are on your PATH. You can do this either
by installing Sumatra::

    $ cd sumatra_src
    $ python setup.py install

(if you do this, you will have to re-run ``setup.py install`` any time you make
changes to the code) *or* by creating symbolic links from somewhere on your PATH
and PYTHONPATH, for example::

    $ cd /some/directory
    $ ln -s sumatra_src/src sumatra
    $ export PYTHONPATH=/some/directory:${PYTHONPATH}
    $ export PATH=/some/directory/sumatra_src/bin:${PATH}

To update to the latest version from the repository::

    $ hg pull -u



Running the test suite
----------------------

Before you make any changes, run the test suite to make sure all the tests pass
on your system::

    $ cd sumatra_src/test/unittests
    $ nosetests

You will see some error messages, but don't worry - these are just tests of
Sumatra's error handling. At the end, if you see "OK", then all the tests
passed, otherwise it will report how many tests failed or produced errors.

If any of the tests fail, check out the `continuous integration server`_ to see
if these are "known" failures, otherwise please `open a bug report`_.

(many thanks to the `NEST Initiative`_ for hosting the CI server).


Writing tests
-------------

You should try to write automated tests for any new code that you add. If you
have found a bug and want to fix it, first write a test that isolates the bug
(and that therefore fails with the existing codebase). Then apply your fix and
check that the test now passes.

To see how well the tests cover the code base, run::

    $ nosetests --coverage --cover-package=sumatra --cover-erase


Committing your changes
-----------------------

Once you are happy with your changes, you can commit them to your local copy of
the repository::

    $ hg commit -m 'informative commit message'
    
If you have a NeuralEnsemble account, you can now push your changes to the
central repository::

    $ hg push https://neuralensemble.org/hg/sumatra

If you are using Bitbucket, you can open a pull request.

Otherwise, you can create a patch::

    $ hg export tip > descriptive_name.patch
    
and attach it to a ticket in the `issue tracker`_. If you have made more than
one commit, determine the revision number of when you cloned or last updated
from the central repository (using ``hg log``), and then give a range of
revisions to include in the patch::

    $ hg export start-revision:tip > descriptive_name.patch

Before either pushing or creating a patch, run the test suite again to check
that you have not introduced any new bugs.


Coding standards and style
--------------------------

All code should conform as much as possible to `PEP 8`_, and should run with
Python 2.6 and 2.7.
