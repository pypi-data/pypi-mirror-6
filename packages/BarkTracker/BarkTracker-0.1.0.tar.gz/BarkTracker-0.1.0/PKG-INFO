Description: Bark Tracker is an application designed for home owners, pet-owners, and
            others who want to monitor the noise level in their homes while they are away. Bark Tracker works by
            detecting noises above a certain threshold (determined by the user) through a microphone connected to
            the user's Raspberry Pi, Desktop, or Laptop. If your dog (or cat, bird, baby, rowdy brother-in-law, etc.)
            makes noise above a certain level of decibels, Bark Tracker sends you an email alerting you to that fact.
        
            To avoid spamming the user with countless emails over the course of a day, Bark Tracker waits 15 minutes
            (or some other amount of time, determined by the user) between emails to alert the user.
