Description: Dose
        ====
        Directory and watching
        ----------------------
        
        **Dose** watches one directory for any kind of change
        new file, file modified, file removed, subdirectory renamed,
        etc., including its subdirectories, by using the Python
        watchdog package. For example, changes on files ending on
        '.pyc' and '.pyo' are neglect by default, as well as git
        internals, but these skip patterns are *customizable*.
        
        What happens when something changes?
        ------------------------------------
        
        A *customized* subprocess is called, all its output/error
        data is left on the shell used to call Dose, and its return
        value is stored. If the value is zero, the semaphore turns
        green, else it it turns red. It stays yellow while waiting
        the subprocess to finish.
        
        Is it easy to use or should I spend hours to set it up?
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        The default directory path to watch is the one used to call
        Dose. There's no default calling string, but 'nosetests' and
        'py.test' would be hints for Python developers. It should
        work even with other languages TDD tools. To be fast, just
        open Dose and double click on it, there's no need to lose
        time with settings.
        
        And the GUI?
        ------------
        
        The GUI toolkit used in this project is wxPython. You can
        move the semaphore by dragging it around. Doing so with
        Ctrl pressed would resize it. With Shift you change its
        transparency (not available on Linux, for now). The
        semaphore window always stays on top. A right click would
        show all options available.
