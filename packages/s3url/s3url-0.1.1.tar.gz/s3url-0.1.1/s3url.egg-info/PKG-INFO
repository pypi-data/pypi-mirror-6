Description: s3url is a simple command line utility for generating time-sensitive,
        sharable urls for private s3 files.
        
        Examples
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Generate a signed URL valid for 24 hours to download
        ``file/to/share.txt`` from the bucket named ``my-bucket``:
        
        ::
        
            $ s3url my-bucket/file/to/share.txt
        
        Also accepts ``s3://`` style URIs:
        
        ::
        
            $ s3url s3://my-bucket/file/to/share.txt
        
        Or ``http(s)://`` URIs (with the bucket as the subdomain or in the
        path):
        
        ::
        
            $ s3url http://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/file/to/share.txt
            $ s3url https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/file/to/share.txt
        
        Specify the time until expiration (1 hour and 30 minutes from now):
        
        ::
        
            $ s3url -e 1h30m my-bucket/file/to/share.txt
        
        AWS credentials are loaded from environment variables by default. Export
        the variables ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``. To
        specify them at the command line, use:
        
        ::
        
            $ s3url -k YourAccessKeyId:YourSecretAccessKey my-bucket/file/to/share.txt
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install with ```pip`` <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`__:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install s3url
