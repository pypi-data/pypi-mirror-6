Description: =================
        niteoweb.ipn.core
        =================
        
        A Plone add-on package that acts as a base for supporting different Instant
        Payment Notification providers (such as PayPal, JVZoo, Click2Sell, etc.)
        
        * `Source code @ GitHub <https://github.com/niteoweb/niteoweb.ipn.core>`_
        * `Releases @ PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/niteoweb.ipn.core>`_
        * `Continuous Integration @ Travis-CI <http://travis-ci.org/niteoweb/niteoweb.ipn.core>`_
        
        Subpackages
        ===========
        
        You probably do not want to use this package on its own, but rather use one
        of its sub-packages:
        
         * `niteoweb.ipn.jvzoo <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/niteoweb.ipn.jvzoo>`_
         * `niteoweb.ipn.c2s (WIP) <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/niteoweb.ipn.c2s>`_
        
        How it works
        ============
        
        This package acts as a base layer for ``niteoweb.ipn.*`` packages. It provides
        the code that these sub-packages would have to otherwise duplicate:
        
         * Creating a new member.
         * Updating an existing member.
         * Disabling an existing member.
         * Firing off events that your project code can catch and perform custom tasks
           on.
        
        The following information is stored as member properties for later use:
        
            ``product_id``
                IPN provider's `Product ID` of the purchased item.
        
            ``affiliate``
                Affiliate who referred the buyer.
        
            ``valid_to``
                Date until the member's subscription is valid.
        
            ``history``
                History of actions taken on the member. Useful for analyses later on.
        
        
        Assumptions
        ===========
        
        * Emails are used as usernames.
        * "Disabling" a member means to revoke her Member role and put her in the
          `Disabled` group, while removing her from all other groups.
        * "Enabling" a member means to create a new member (if she doesn't exist yet),
          grant her the Member role (if she doesn't have it yet) and add her to the
          Product Group.
        * "Product Group" is a group that contains members that have purchased the same
          product. Product group IDs are equal to Product IDs -- this is how they are
          linked together.
        * When niteoweb.ipn.core creates a new member object, the registration email is
          **not** sent. Your third-party code should take care of this (for example by
          subscribing to the IPrincipalCreatedEvent emitted by PAS).
        * Whenever a member is enabled, a 'valid_to' property is set on the member
          object to represent until which day should this member be allowed to use the
          site. You then need to setup a cronjob that calls ``@@validity`` view every
          day to disable those members whose validity period has elapsed. In the
          plone.app.registry control panel you can set a secret that needs to be passed
          as a request parameter to the ``@@validity`` view.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You probably do not want to install `niteoweb.ipn.core` directly, but rather
        use one of ``niteoweb.ipn.*`` sub-packages.
