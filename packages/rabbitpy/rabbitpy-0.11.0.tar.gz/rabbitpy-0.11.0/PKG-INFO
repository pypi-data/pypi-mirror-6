Description: rabbitpy - rabbitmq simplified
        ==============================

        Installation
        ------------
        
        rabbitpy may be installed via the Python package index with the tool of
        your choice. I prefer pip:
        
        ::
        
            pip install rabbitpy
        
        But there's always easy_install:
        
        ::
        
            easy_install rabbitpy
        
        rmqid Compatibility
        -------------------
        
        rabbitpy is API compatible with rmqid.

        https://rabbitpy.readthedocs.org
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  pamqp - https://github.com/pika/pamqp
        -  requests - http://docs.python-requests.org/
        
        Python3 Caveats
        ---------------
        
        -  Message bodies must use the bytes data type while most other values
           are strings.
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Simple Publisher
        ----------------
        
        The simple publisher is ideal for sending one off messages:
        
        ::
        
            >>> rabbitpy.publish('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f',
                                 exchange='test',
                                 routing_key='example',
                                 body='This is my test message')
        
        If you want to add properties:
        
        ::
        
            >>> rabbitpy.publish('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f',
                                 exchange='test',
                                 routing_key='example',
                                 body='This is my test message',
                                 properties={'content_type': 'text/plain'})
        
        And publisher confirms:
        
        ::
        
            >>> rabbitpy.publish('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f',
                                 exchange='test',
                                 routing_key='example',
                                 body='This is my test message',
                                 properties={'content_type': 'text/plain'},
                                 confirm=True)
            True
            >>>
        
        Simple Getter
        -------------
        
        ::
        
            >>> m = rabbitpy.get('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f', 'test')
            >>> m.json()
            {u'foo': u'bar'}
        
        Simple Consumer
        ---------------
        
        ::
        
            >>> with rabbitpy.consume('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f', 'test') as c:
            ..    for message in c.next_message():
            ...         print message.properties['message_id']
            ...         print message.body
            ...         message.ack()
            ...
            856dfdc7-5ee3-4fc1-9635-977bf0043a9f
            {"foo": "bar"}
