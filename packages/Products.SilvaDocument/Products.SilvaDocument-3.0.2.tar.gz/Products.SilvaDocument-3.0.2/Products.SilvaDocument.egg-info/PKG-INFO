Description: ==============
        Silva Document
        ==============
        
        Silva Document allow you to create structured documents, using the
        WYSIWYG `Kupu`_ editor.
        
        In `Silva`_ 3.0, the Kupu editor is no longer supported. This
        extension does no longer let edit documents with `Kupu`_. But you can
        use to render documents, and convert them to the new document type of
        `Silva`_ 3.0, ``silva.app.document``.
        
        In previous versions of Silva, you can use this extension to edit
        documents with `Kupu`_. Please look at older versions for this.
