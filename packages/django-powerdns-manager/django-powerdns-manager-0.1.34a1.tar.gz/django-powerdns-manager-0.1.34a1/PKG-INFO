        .. warning::
        
           *django-powerdns-manager* should be considered **work in progress**.
           Until the first stable release is out, changes to the database schema and
           the supported features may occur without notice and without the provision
           of migration instructions or scripts.
           
           Please, do not use this software in production.
           
           As soon as the first stable release is out, backwards compatibility will be
           preserved and release notes containing migration instructions will be
           published in future releases.
           
           If you still need to use this software in production, you are on your own.
           In such a case, it is recommended to pick a release that works for you and
           stick to it without upgrading, until the first final version is out.

        - Automatic zone-rectify support, including support for empty non-terminals,
          using native python code.
        - The application can be configured to support a user-defined subset of the
          resource records supported by PowerDNS and customize the order in which they
          appear in the administration panel.
        - Zone cloning (experimental).
        - Zone transfers between users.
