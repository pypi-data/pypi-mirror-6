pyheapdump
==========

Post-mortem debugging for Python. 

As you can see, the documentation is not yet complete.


Acknowledgement and Previous Work
---------------------------------

This Python extension is based on the Pydump (https://github.com/gooli/pydump), a Python extension written 
and published by Eli Finer. During the development of pyheapdump my code diverged from 
Eli's work to a point where nearly no common code was left. I decided, to rename my work to
pyheapdump in order to make it clear, that it is now a separate project.
