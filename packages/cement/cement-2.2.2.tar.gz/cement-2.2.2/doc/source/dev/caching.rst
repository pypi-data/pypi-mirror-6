Cache Handling
==============

Cement defines a cache interface called :ref:`ICache <cement.core.cache>`,
but does not implement caching by default.  The documentation below references
usage based on the interface and not the full capabilities of any given
implementation.

The following cache handlers are included and maintained with Cement:

    * None

Please reference the :ref:`ICache <cement.core.cache>` interface
documentation for writing your own cache handler.

General Usage
-------------

For this example we use the Memcached extension.  This requires the pylibmc
library to be installed, as well as a Memcached server running on localhost.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from cement.core import foundation

    app = foundation.CementApp('myapp',
                               extensions=['memcached'],
                               cache_handler='memcached')

    try:
        app.setup()
        app.run()

        # Set a cached value
        app.cache.set('my_key', 'my value')

        # Get a cached value
        app.cache.get('my_key')

        # Delete a cached value
        app.cache.delete('my_key')

        # Delete the entire cache
        app.cache.purge()

    finally:
        app.close()
