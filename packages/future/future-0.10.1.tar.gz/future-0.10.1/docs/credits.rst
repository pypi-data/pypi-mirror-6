:Others:  - The backported ``super()`` and ``range()`` functions are
            derived from Ryan Kelly's ``magicsuper`` module and Dan
            Crosta's ``xrange`` module.
          - The ``futurize`` script uses ``lib2to3``, ``lib3to2``, and
            parts of Armin Ronacher's ``python-modernize`` code.
          - The ``python_2_unicode_compatible`` decorator is from
            Django. The ``implements_iterator`` and ``with_metaclass``
            decorators are from Jinja2.
          - ``future`` incorporates the ``six`` module by Benjamin
            Peterson as ``future.utils.six``.
          - Documentation is generated using ``sphinx`` using an
            adaptation of Armin Ronacher's stylesheets from Jinja2.
