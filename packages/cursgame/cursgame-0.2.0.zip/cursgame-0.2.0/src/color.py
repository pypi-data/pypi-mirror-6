"""Contains functions and constants related to colors.

This module provides a higher level interface to the color system of
curses.

The constants in the form COL_RAW (where COL is a color) are
constants for defining own color pairs. This mechanism is described in
the curses manual. For defining color pairs this module contains the
functions init_pair and color_pair from curses. After you made the
color_pair you must wrap it in a cusrgame-color-constant. For this
purpose pass the color_pair to the function make_colorcons.

Normally you want to use a predefined color. For this purpose this
module provides the following color_constants:
WHITE
RED
GREEN
YELLOW
BLUE
MAGENTA
CYAN
BLACK
