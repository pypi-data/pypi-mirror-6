Whenever a leap second is added to the civil calendar, 
the file src/tpm/delta_AT.c must be
updated to reflect the new accumulated number of leap seconds for
subsequent dates.

You can compute the MJD test value that should be added to the code
using the AstroDate class as follows:

import datetime
from coords import AstroDate

newyear=datetime.datetime(2009,1,1)  #year, month, day, 0, 0, 0
t=AstroDate(newyear)
t.mjd
