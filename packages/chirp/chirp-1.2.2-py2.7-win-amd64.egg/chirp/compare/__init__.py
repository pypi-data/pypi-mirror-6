"""
modules for comparing vocalizations.

This component of chirp uses a plugin-based architecture to allow
users to define new comparison methods.  Plugins should register under
the entry point '%s', using the method name as a key.

base_comparison:  defines the methods needed by a comparison class
pitch_dtw:        compare signals using dynamic time warping of pitch traces
spcc:             compare signals using spectrographic cross-correlation
