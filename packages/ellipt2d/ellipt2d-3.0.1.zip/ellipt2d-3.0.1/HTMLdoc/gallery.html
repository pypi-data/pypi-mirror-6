<P> Here the Helmholtz equation (with k = 2*pi) is solved on a realistic plasma and limiter geometry. Dirichlet boundary condition are set to 1.0 on the plasmaand 0.0 on the limiter. The unstructured mesh has 556 triangles.

Complex eigenvalue problem. The equation is of Helmholtz type with 
zero Dirichlet conditions on the internal boundary and phase shifted 
conditions on the outer edges. Represented is a higher order mode: the 
surface height corresponds to the mode amplitude whereas the colored
contours represent the phase.  Regions with accumulation of red-blue 
contours are associated with a phase transition from pi to -pi. Rendering
in OpenDX.

Solve Helmholtz's equation on a hexagonal shaped domain to recover
Christopherson's well known pattern cell solutions. 
(D G Christopherson, Quart. J. of Math., 11, 63-65 (1941)).
The unstructured mesh has 675 triangles.
