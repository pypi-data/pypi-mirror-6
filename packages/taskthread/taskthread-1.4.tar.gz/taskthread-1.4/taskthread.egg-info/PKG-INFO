Description: TaskThread
        ==========
        
        Python thread module to repeat an predefined task on a thread mulitple times.
        A TaskThread is useful when a task needs to be repeated several times on 
        a separate thread. Normal usage of the threading.Thread class would call for
        creation of a new thread each time the same task needs to be run. This module
        allows for repetitive tasks to be run multiple times on the same thread by having
        the thread wait until the task needs to be executed again.
