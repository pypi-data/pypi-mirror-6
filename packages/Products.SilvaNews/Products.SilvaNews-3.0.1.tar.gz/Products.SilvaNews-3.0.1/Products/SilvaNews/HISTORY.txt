New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- First release for Silva 2.2, no longer backwards compatible
  with prior Silva releases

- News and Agenda Viewers now have a "Year Range" property which
  controls the number of years in the past and future wich are
  displayed in the archive.  Attempts to access years outside
  of this range will raise 404's.

- SilvaNews has popup calendars for start/end datetimes in the SMI

- SilvaNews no longer manages it's own upgraders.  Upgrading SilvaNews
  is now tied into the core Silva upgrade process.

New Features ported from SNN 2.7.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- removing '<<' and '>>' from links and putting the the html
  entities in a span
- adding wrappers for the news and agenda archive content area
- adding a vertical separator between months

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed issue that made that broken images in news items resulted in
  failing searches.

- Added 'unblock' css class to viewer field iterators so links render
  properly (resulting from removal of the sortable id/class)

- correct localization datetime issues with rssaggregator's rss/atom feeds
  and inlineviewer newsprovider.

- AgendaViewers were pulling the latest number of items, rather
  than all items in X days.

- Update last author when an article/agenda item is saved in kupu.

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7.5 (2009-03-26)
-----------------------------------

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The 'publish now' button in the edit tab of news items raised a 404
  when clicked, and it wasn't translated.

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7.4 (2009-03-05)
-----------------------------------

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The rss.xml feed on news and agenda viewers did not validate against
  the rss 1.0 specification

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7.3 (2009/02/19)
-----------------------------------

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The 'publish now' button for news and agenda items was not
  setting the display date time.  The result was that new items
  would not be found by filters

- removed the SNN 2.6 upgrader (which refreshes the catalog).
  All news items do need to be reindexed.  To do this, use the
  "Partial catalog rebuilds" tab of the Silva Extensions Service
  (in the ZMI) to rebuild each Silva News Publication.

- Added a dummy upgrader for SNN 2.7, so it appears that
  the upgrade upgrades to 2.7

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7.2 (2009/02/12)
-----------------------------------

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- removed debugging output on rss aggregator public view,
  and added additional css classes

- rss aggregator public view: adjusted feed link to be the
  html link, rather than the uri of the syndication feed

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7.1 (2009/02/11)
-----------------------------------

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- changed the viewer public language back so that translations
  work.

- Added 'unblock' css class to viewer field iterators so links render
  properly (resulting from removal of the sortable id/class)

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7
--------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The RSS Aggregator now merges/sorts the feeds based on each
  feed item's publication date.

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The AgendaViewer displays the same number of characters
  for each item's intro as NewsViewers do (i.e. 128)

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.6
--------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Moved the "new version" button in the editor screen below the
  feedback text, as opposed to nestled in the corner next to the
  text. This because a Silva trainer reported that a trainee
  couldn't figure out how to make a new version. Now it's more
  obvious, hopefully enough.

- added the end date/time and location properties of Agenda
  Items to the agenda item add screen.

- added the location property of Agenda Items to the public view

- working with Zope 2.10 (ala merge 2.4-zope-2.10-branch)

- registering content via 'silva' zcml directives

- worked up SilvaNews interfaces a bit

- Added a SilvaNewsCategoryFilter asset, which can be used to
  limit the category lists in Filters and the properties tool in
  the News Item editor.

- refactored the viewers, merging shared code

- Added metadata columns for frequently accessed newsitem data
  (including get_intro!)

- Refactored News/Agenda viewers:

  1. to use new metadata columns

  2. each of the three public views (standard, archive, search)
     uses a shared macro to render the items, ensuring consistent
     display between all three views.

- eliminated all calls to getObject() (catalogbrain) in the
  filters -- since it's a "slow" operation, the cases where this
  was required are now using the additional catalog metadata
  columns.

- Added rss.xml and atom.xml views, based on the Silva 2.0
  rss.xml Container view.  These use the framework laid out for
  container rss, and include extra tags for silvanews specific
  metadata (location, start,end dates)

- rss.xml and atom.xml also work for RSSAggregator

- Removed XMLBuffer, as it is no longer used

- added interfaces INewsViewer and IAgendaViewer. These
  interfaces can be used by SilvaLayout/Five to provide special
  views for news/agenda viewers.

- InlineNewsViewer was updated with some Z3 features, e.g. using
  the Z3 interface lookup.

- The default INV formulator form and view templates have new
  features including: containing div id and class, showing a
  search box, specifying article level, optional image
  thumbnail, where and whether to place links to articles, and
  possible a few others.  If you're using the default INV, you
  should refresh the template by going to the each INV's url and
  adding '/refresh', e.g. http://server.com/silva/inv/refresh

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed the new version button in the editor screen from an
  input to a button, to avoid css conflicts with frontend.css
  controls styles

- 176581: removed Category Filter preview tab, and registered a
  "dummy" public view for this content type

- 160505: SNN News Publications cannot have addables settings.
  It should, being News Publications inherit from Publications.

- viewers displayed items in reverse order when using multiple
  filters

- Improved (simplified the css of) the properties toolbox layout

- fix for broken rss feed caused by get_intro() not getting the
  model

- using 'get_intro' for RSS feeds introduced a bug in at least
  some RSS feeds. This has been worked around.

- fix in NewsFilter.get_next_items, to catch _all_ agenda item
  cases

- Publishing using the "publish now" button on the edit tab for
  news items was slightly broken.  The resultant page returned
  after this action had a <base> tag set to the news item
  version instead of the news item itself, breaking navigation
  links.

- Made layout of the INV (Inline News Viewer) more generic using standard
  Silva html classes

- Fixed space above kupu more robustly, so other extensions can control

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.1.2
----------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed support for code sources (external sources) in news items.

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.1.1
----------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed some documentation issues: some version numbers were wrong.

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.1
--------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Added upgrader for a specific Zope 2.8.x issue, where some ZCatalog
  indexes had a new attribute defined, but the upgrader for that
  attribute wasn't executed when required.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- SilvaNewsNetwork now works on (and depends on!) Silva 1.5.

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.0.2
----------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed Kupu ExternalSources support in news items. Thanks to Andrew
  Altepeter.

- Fixed bug where upgrader was registered for the wrong meta type. Thanks
  to Marc Petitmermet.

- Added dummy upgrader for 1.2, which makes that the upgrades are
  actually ran when the data version is 1.2 (works around a bug in
  Silva's upgrade registry).

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.0.1
----------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Added missing upgraders for 1.3 (or below) to 2.0.

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.0
--------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Kupu editor support for news items (replacing the widget editor)

- Name change from SilvaNews to SilvaNewsNetwork

SilvaNewsNetwork 1.3
--------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- In each item in a news viewer, the first image of the item's content
  (if available) is displayed as a thumbnail.

- Removed all tables from the public views to more easily allow styling
  and layouting with CSS (note that this changes the layout of the public
  views!)

- Added a new checkbox in Agenda Items, 'display time', to control
  whether the time part of start and end date/time is displayed in
  the public views, allowing times of 00:00 to be displayed.

- Added a couple of new fields to service_news to allow displaying
  dates and months in a certain locale and format (this is a global
  setting rather than a per-user one, because Silva content currently
  can not be presented in more than one language it doesn't make sense
  to display dates and months in different languages).

- Added a new field 'display_datetime' to news items, rather than using
  the publication date/time to determine if and where an item is
  displayed in a news viewer, this display date is used, e.g. allowing
  re-publishing of an item without moving it in the public view of news
  viewers.

- Agenda items are now displayed according to the end datetime, if
  available, so that an item disappears from the list of 'current events'
  when it ends rather than when it starts.

- Subjects and target audiences now have a title, which allows changing
  the way they are displayed without having to update stored references
  to them (so you can now 'change a subject' and still have newsviewers
  display the correct list of items).

- Rather than displaying the first subheader encountered in the news item
  and the first paragraph encountered (which enforced a certain structure
  on news item content to make the viewers display the items correctly)
  news viewers now display the first *bit* of the news item, regardless
  of the type of elements that contains. Note that this requires some
  changes in the public templates (the subheader() and lead() methods
  have been replaced by one called 'get_intro').

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The 'number of items to display' field on news viewers used to limit
  the number of items displayed in the archive, which made certain items
  not get displayed anymore, this is not fixed.

SilvaNewsNetwork 1.2
--------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Updated SilvaNews to work with Silva 1.2

SilvaNewsNetwork 1.1
--------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed the names of indexes so they're less likely to clash with
  names of user-generated objects - SEE UPGRADE.txt!

SilvaNewsNetwork 1.0
--------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed 'select all' in edit tabs.

- Fixed some small template issues so it works correctly with Silva 1.0.

- Problem in some DateTime argument formatting solved that made viewing
      certain objects result in an IOError when Silva was running on Windows
      Zope installations.

SilvaNewsNetwork 0.9.1
----------------------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Silva News really depends on Silva Document, not just Silva core.

SilvaNewsNetwork 0.9
--------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- RSS 1.0 overviews on NewsViewers and Aggregators.
  By adding /rss to the URL of a NewsViews, one will
  get the RSS 1.0 feed for this viewer or aggregator.

- Removed the RSSViewer (replaced by the RSSAggregator).

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed just about all Silva 0.9.3 conversion issues.

Note: SilvaNews 0.9 is incompatible with previously released
versions.
