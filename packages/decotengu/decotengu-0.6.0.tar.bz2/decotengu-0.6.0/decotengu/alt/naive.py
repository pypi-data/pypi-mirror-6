"""
Naive decompression code.

The implemented algorithms

- ascent jump - go to next depth, then calculate tissue saturation for
  time, which would take to get from previous to next depth (can be used
  when trying to avoid Schreiner equation)
- deco stop stepper - perform dive decompression using 1min intervals

The algorithms are quite inefficient, usually O(n) while O(log(n))
algorithm could be used. They are implemented in DecoTengu only for
comparison purposes.

    Ascent by jumping (teleporting).

    Simulate ascent by jumping to shallower depth and stay there for
    appropriate amount of time. The depth jump and time are determined by
    ascent rate, i.e. for 10m/min the depth jump is 10m and time is 1 minute.

    Such ascent simulation allows to avoid Schreiner equation, but is less
    accurate. The longer depth jump, the less accuracy. Do not use for
    ascents faster than 10m/min.
