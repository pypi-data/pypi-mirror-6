        blacksentiments v.0.1
        =====================
        
        Fast sentiment analysis for the Black Speech of Mordor as given in the works of
        J. R. R. Tolkien in his Middle-earth mythos.  Works for both the ancient mode
        of Black Speech as used by Sauron and the Nazg√ªl, and the 'debased' Orkish form
        used by the soldiery.
        
        Robustness has been sacrificed for speed, and so it is to be noted that the
        classifier is, being so specialised, likely to return spurious results if it is
        fed non-Black Speech text.  I leave the determining of the input string as
        genuine Black Speech as an exercise for the interested.
