== Introduction ==

This is python-qualysconnect. A Python package that provides rudimentary access
to the QualysGuard (R) API (v1 and v2). This project is Copyright (c)

== Installation ==

$ python setup.py install

NOTE: If you would like to experiment without installing globally, look into 'virtualenv'.

=== Requirements ===

* ipaddr-py (https://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/)

* lxml (http://lxml.de/)

I've only tested this with Python 2.7.x,  I will need to work to convert it to Python 3.x.

== Configuration ==

By default, the package will ask at the command prompt for username and
password.  By default, the package connects to the Qualys documented host
(qualysapi.qualys.com).  You can override these settings and prevent yourself
from typing credentials by creating a file called '.qcrc' in your home
directory.  (Sorry, I do not have this tested on Windows yet).

=== Example .qcrc ===

; Note, it should be possible to omit any of these entries.

[info]
hostname = qualysapi.serviceprovider.com
username = corp_tt
password = passw0rd

== Usage ==

A script called 'qhostinfo.py' is included and installed with setup.py.

Usage: qhostinfo.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Display detailed logging messages.
  -a IP, --address=IP   Display QualysGuard results for IP.
  -H HOSTNAME, --hostname=HOSTNAME
                        Display QualysGuard results for HOSTNAME.
Usage: qhostinfo.py [options]

== Source Code Examples ==

The bitbucket repository contains a directory called 'examples' that provides
barebones examples of the setup of a v1 and v2 connection.
