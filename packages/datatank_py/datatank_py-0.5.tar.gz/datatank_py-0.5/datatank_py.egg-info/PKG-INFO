        WHAT IS THIS?
        =============

        This is a Python module that allows you to read and write DataTank data files using
        Python. `DataTank <http://visualdatatools.com/DataTank/>`_ is a visualization and 
        analysis tool for Mac OS X, but datatank_py is cross-platform.
        
        `Documentation <http://amaxwell.github.io/datatank_py>`_

        Although DataTank itself is proprietary (now free of
        charge for students and postdocs), it includes open-source C++ libraries for most
        of the internal data structures, so you can easily create data files to be loaded
        into it. The datatank_py module is a reimplementation of the C++ libraries, so
        tends to be more Pythonic.
