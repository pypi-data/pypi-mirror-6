Description: Virtual Touchpad
        ================
        
        This application allows you to use a mobile phone or tablet as a touchpad for
        your computer.
        
        No software needs to be installed on the device.
        
        
        How does it work?
        -----------------
        
        A simple HTTP server is started on the computer, and the device connects by
        simply opening a URL in a browser.
        
        To manually start the HTTP server, run the following command:
        
            python -m virtualtouchpad
        
        This will start a HTTP server. It will print the line
        
            Starting server http://<computer name>:<port>/...
        
        Open this URL on your device to start controlling your computer.
