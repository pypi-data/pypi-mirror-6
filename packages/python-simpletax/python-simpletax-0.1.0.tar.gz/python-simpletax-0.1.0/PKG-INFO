Description: # Python wrapper for SimpleTax API
        
        SimpleTax (http://gosimpletax.com) is the free, web-based tax software that helps you easily find the most savings and ensures you file an accurate tax return, no matter how complicated your affairs are.
        
        This Python library allows you to integrate your application with SimpleTax via it's REST API. It relies on OAuth2 for authorising access to a user's account.
        
        # Installation
        
        The fast way to install the library is:
        ```
        pip install -e https://github.com/Leftfield/python-simpletax.git#egg=simpletax
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        This library acts an OAuth2 consumer, leveraging the requests-oauthlib library. To request a client ID and secret please contact the SimpleTax team, at hello@gosimpletax.com.
        
        Sample code to make API calls:
        
        ```
        from api import SimpleTax
        
        # the client_id and secret obtained from the SimpleTax team
        client_id = ''
        client_secret = ''
        
        # the redirect_uri should be the URI to which users are redirected after authorising access to their account from your app
        redirect_uri = 'https://localhost/'
        
        simpletax = SimpleTax(client_id,redirect_uri=redirect_uri)
        authorization_url,state = simpletax.authorization_url(SimpleTax.OAUTH_AUTHZ_URL)
        
        print 'Please authorize me in the browser: ',authorization_url
        redirect_url = raw_input('Copy the redirect URL here: ')
        
        token = simpletax.fetch_token(SimpleTax.OAUTH_TOKEN_URL,client_secret=client_secret,authorization_response=redirect_url)
        print 'Ready to roll...'
        
        simpletax.add_income(2500,description='Customer invoice')
        simpletax.add_expense(200,description='Photoshop license')
        
        print 'Check the result on your SimpleTax account'
        ```
