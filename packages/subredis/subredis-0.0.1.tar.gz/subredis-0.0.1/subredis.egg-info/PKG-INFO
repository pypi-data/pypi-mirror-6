Description: Subredis Redis Keyspace Management
        --------------------------------
        
        Do you ever want to give part of your application its own redis instance
        to do with as it please?
        
        This is exactly what subredis does. With a single redis backing instance,
        subredis wraps that instance and provides a fairly complete redis
        implementation,storing the data in keys prefixed by a specified prefix. IE
        
            sr = SubRedis("subspace", redis)
        
            # Work within the "subspace" keyspace
            sr.set("foo", "bar")
            sr.get("foo")
            sr.flushdb()
        
        Most direct uses of redis data structures are supported. Lua scripting and
        many of the administrative methods are not supported.
