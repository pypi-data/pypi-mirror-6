        =============================
        
        Narc is a a program that's primary function is to be an auto-responder to Slick
        (http://code.google.com/p/slickqa) events.
        
        Although it's first usage will be for sending emails (or narc'ing on slick),
        narc is built to be pluggable and respond to any events in slick.
        
        Usage is simple, a command line script is included in the program, simply run
        it.  By default it looks for a configuration file in /etc/narc.ini, however
        you can customize what configuration file it uses by using the command line
        switch of -c or --config and specify a different configuration file.
