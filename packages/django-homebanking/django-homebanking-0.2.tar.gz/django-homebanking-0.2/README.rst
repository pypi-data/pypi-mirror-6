python-django-homebanking
#########################

First of all, this project is very poorly named.

It's a little something I built to keep track of my personal finances. It integrates well with python-sparnord, which can pull the data directly from my homebanking system. It then categorizes all the entries and makes it easy for me to track how I've spent my money.
