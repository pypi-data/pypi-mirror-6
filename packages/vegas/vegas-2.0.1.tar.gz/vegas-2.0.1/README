vegas
-----
This package is for evaluating multidimensional integrals using
an improved version of the adaptive Monte Carlo vegas algorithm.
The central package is :mod:`vegas`. A tutorial on its use
is in doc/html/index.html (or doc/vegas.pdf if you prefer pdf).

The vegas algorithm has been widely used for decades to evaluate
integrals of 2 or more dimensions numerically. It is particularly
well suited to higher dimensions (eg, 8 or 13 for Feynman diagram
evaluation). The algorithm in this package is significantly 
improved over the original vegas implementation. In particular 
a second adaptive strategy has been added.  

Test :mod:`vegas` using 'make tests.' Some simple examples are
in the examples directory.

Installation instructions are in the INSTALLATION file.
