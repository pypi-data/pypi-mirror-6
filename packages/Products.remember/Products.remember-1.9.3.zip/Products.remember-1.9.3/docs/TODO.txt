Pending TODOs:

- simplify member-object workflow design and operation by using content
  rules to detect member profile changes and trigger automatic transitions,
  rather than Extensions/triggerAutomaticTransitions keyed on the update
  methods.  (i have a working implementation in a subproduct, but it would
  need some backwards compat provisions for existing member based content.)

- Reconcile membership account's incidentals - preferences / dashboard /
  password-change stuff - with standard membership provisions, so there
  aren't multiple and disparate places to set things.  similarly, integrate
  the portal_memberdata container with views that make it useful.  Among
  many things: the remove option in the users configlet
  (@@usergroup-userprefs) fails; the standard 'Personal' / Personal
  Information (@@personal-information) configlet involves an overlapping
  but different set of attributes than the member content item's edit view;
  there is more.

- simplify extension and customization of member profile schemas, perhaps
  by migrating to dexterity.

- complete the uninstall provisions, so portals from which
  Products.remember was uninstalled do not depend in any way on
  Products.remember code being present.
