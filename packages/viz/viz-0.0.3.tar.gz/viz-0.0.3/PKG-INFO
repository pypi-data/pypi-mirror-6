Description: viz
        ===
        
        Data visualization in the terminal.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        **From PyPI:**
        
        ::
        
            easy_install viz
        
        **From source:**
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/chbrown/viz.git
            cd viz
            python setup.py install
        
        The main CLI script is ``viz``, which should be installed on your
        ``PATH``.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Ping google every 100ms (0.1s) and plot the first 50 response times you
        get back:
        
        ::
        
            ping -i 0.1 google.com | head -50 | sed -n 's/.*time=\(.*\) ms/\1/p' | viz hist
        
        Example result (which should fit your terminal width automatically):
        
        ::
        
            26.1390000[ (cannot display with only ascii) ]39.5580000
