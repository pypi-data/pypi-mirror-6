        Visualization of multibody systems generated with PyDy.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        This package relies on dependencies included in the SciPy stack (i.e. NumPy and
        matplotlib). These packages are not necessarily easy to install from source, so
        it is best to follow the instructions available on the `SciPy installation
        page`_.
        
        .. _SciPy installation page: http://www.scipy.org/install.html
        
        One example of installing the setuptools, NumPy, and matplotlib dependencies
        for Debian based Linux systems is to install from the apt package manager::
        
           $ apt-get install python-setuptools python-numpy python-matplotlib
        
        Once the dependencies are installed, then download the source and install with::
        
           $ python setup.py install
        
        This will automatically install the latest version of the final dependency
        SymPy if needed.
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        The Python tests require nose so get them with your package manager::
        
           $ apt-get python-nose python-coverage
        
        or pip::
        
           $ pip install nose coverage
        
        The tests can be run from the root directory with::
        
           $ nosetests
        
        And to see more detail with coverage, run::
        
           $ nosetests -v --with-coverage --cover-package=pydy_viz
        
        These are alternative ways to run the Python tests::
        
           $ bin/test
           $ python setup.py nosetests
        
        For the Javascript tests the Jasmine and blanket.js libraries are used.  Both
        of these libraries are included in pydy-viz with the source. To run the
        Javascript tests, go to the javascript library directory::
        
           $ cd pydy_viz/static/js
        
        Then run a simple HTTP Server with Python (the server is required due to some
        cross browser issues with blanket.js)::
        
           $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        
        Now visit http://localhost:8000/SpecRunner.html in a webgl compliant browser.
