Description: News plugin for django-cms 2.x
        ===============================
        
        This plugin provides a simple news feature for django-cms 2.0 and newer and
        and tries to keep it as simple as possible without extras like tagging or
        categories but while providing a news feed and menu integration.
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        * Install django-cms (if you haven't done so already)
        
        * Run `pip install cmsplugin-news` or download this package and run
          `python setup.py install` or add it in some other way to your current
          PYTHON_PATH
        
        * Add 'cmsplugin_news' and 'cms.plugins.text' to INSTALLED_APPS
        
        * If you're using South execute `python manage.py migrate`, Otherwise run
          `python manage.py syncdb` within your project directory.
        * In order to integrate the news-plugin with your website, create a page and add
          the news application (and optionally the news menu) to it by modifying the
          relevant "advanced settings" of it.
