Description: =======================================================
        cbmcodecs - Python encodings for handling PETSCII text.
        =======================================================
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        The cbmcodecs package provides a number of encodings for handling text from
        Commodore 8-bit systems. Much of the credit for this package must go to
        Linus Walleij of Triad, as these codecs were built from his PETSCII to Unicode
        mappings which can be found at www.df.lth.se/~triad/krad/recode/petscii.html
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Currently there are 4 codecs defined for variations of the PETSCII encoding:
        
        petscii-c64en-lc
            The English version of the Commodore 64 mixed-case character set
        
        petscii-c64en-uc
            The English version of the Commodore 64 upper-case/graphics character set
        
        petscii-vic20en-lc
            The English version of the VIC-20 mixed-case character set
        
        petscii-vic20en-uc
            The English version of the VIC-20 upper-case/graphics character set
        
        Simply import the cbmcodecs package and you will then be able to use them as
        with any of the encodings from the standard library::
        
            import cbmcodecs
        
        
            with open('file.seq', encoding='pettscii-c64en-lc') as f:
                for line in f:
                    print(line)
        
        Python Version Note
        ===================
        
        Currently only Python 3 is supported(tested on 3.3.3). Support for Python 2.7
        may be added in the future, but supporting Python 2 isn't very high on my
        priority list.
