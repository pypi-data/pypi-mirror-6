Description: pyramid_clamav
        ==============
        
        Pyramid tween which checks file uploads for viruses using clamav.
        
        You need to have a running clamav installation on your system to which
        the tween can connect via a unix socket. You can set the socket path in
        your config (pyramid_clamav.socket), but the defaults should work on most
        systems.
        
        If you want to deactivate scanning (i.e. for testing or your local development
        environment), you can set pyramid_clamav.debug to a value. Then flash- and 
        logmessages are generated if there was a file upload *and* clamav is not 
        properly configured.
        
        If a virus was found, the file is removed from the request. The field which
        was used to upload the file should handle it like no file was uploaded.
        
        A flashmessage is presented to the user stating that a file contained a virus
        and it has been removed.
        
        It should also work for multiple files.

        0.3 (2013-12-19)
        ----------------
        
        - pyramid_clamav.debug can now be set in config. If enabled AND clamav is not
          configured, it will generate a flash message when a file upload was found,
          but the file will not be touched. Additionally errors are logged at startup
          and on file uploads.
