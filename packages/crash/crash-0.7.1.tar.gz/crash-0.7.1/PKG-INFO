        Crate Shell
        ===========
        
        The crash shell provides a CLI for the Crate Server.
        
        If the package was installed using `pip` the shell can be started by
        invoking `crash` in a terminal.
        
        `crash` by default will try to connect to `localhost:4200`. To connect to
        another host use the `connect` command inside the shell or use the `--hosts`
        argument when launching the shell.
        
        When you connect to a server that is not reachable or whose hostname cannot be resolved
        you will get an error::
        
            cr> connect 127.0.0.1:65535
            +------------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------+
            | server_url             | node_name | connected | message            |
            +------------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------+
            | http://127.0.0.1:65535 | NULL      | FALSE     | Connection refused |
            +------------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------+
            CONNECT ERROR
        
            cr> connect null.lol:4200
            +----------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------+
            | server_url           | node_name | connected | message                        |
            +----------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------+
            | http://null.lol:4200 | NULL      | FALSE     | Hostname could no be resolved. |
            +----------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------+
            CONNECT ERROR
        
        
        Successful connects will give you some information about the servers you connect to::
        
            cr> connect 127.0.0.1:44209
            +------------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+
            | server_url             | node_name | connected | message |
            +------------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+
            | http://127.0.0.1:44209 | crate     | TRUE      | OK      |
            +------------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+
            CONNECT OK
        
        If you connect to more than one server, the command will succeed
        if at least one server is reachable::
        
            cr> CONNECT 127.0.0.1:44209 null.lol:4295
            +------------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------+
            | server_url             | node_name | connected | message                        |
            +------------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------+
            | http://127.0.0.1:44209 | crate     | TRUE      | OK                             |
            | http://null.lol:4295   | NULL      | FALSE     | Hostname could no be resolved. |
            +------------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------------------------+
            CONNECT OK
        
        Once the shell is connected, SQL statements can be executed simply by entering
        them without any special arguments like this::
        
            cr> SELECT schema_name, table_name from information_schema.tables
            ... order by table_name
            +--------------------+-------------------+
            | schema_name        | table_name        |
            +--------------------+-------------------+
            | sys                | cluster           |
            | information_schema | columns           |
            | sys                | nodes             |
            | sys                | shards            |
            | information_schema | table_constraints |
            | information_schema | tables            |
            +--------------------+-------------------+
            SELECT 6 rows in set (... sec)
