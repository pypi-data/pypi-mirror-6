Description: WAYTT
        =====
        
        Who Are You Talking To?, a python c module for measuring network traffic by destination and source.
        
        How does it work?
        =================
        
        The basis of the system is pcap; libpcap on linux and WinPcap on windows. pcap is used to list network adaptors and to capture traffic on a specified adaptor, however WAYTT is optimised for measuring traffic and as such ignores the contents of the network packets other that the source, destination and size.
        
        Origins
        =======
        
        This project is a reimangining of an earlier project called WebMonitorDaemon and later renamed to DiNeMeterDaemon, which can be found at github.com/othrayte/DiNeMeter.
        
        License
        =======
        
        WAYTT is provided under the GPLv3 (or later) license see the LICENSE file and code headers.
        
        DiNeMeter, the project that WAYTT is originally based on was GPLv3 licenesed and so is this one, however as the sole rights holder of DiNeMeter I am able, and possibly willing, to arrange other licenses for this work on a case by case basis.
