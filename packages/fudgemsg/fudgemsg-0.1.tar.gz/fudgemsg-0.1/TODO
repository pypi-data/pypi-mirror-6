* Use taxonomy to calculate field size and encode/decode - DONE
 - Still to check that the logic for using taxonomies is ok.

* encode/decode of Message objects - DONE

* Context object
  * Allow for custom registry
  * Allow for Taxonomy map

* Stream based encode/decode

* Unnkown Field Handling

* Secondary types

* Pretty printer - DONE
* simple dumper reading messages from disk and printing it - DONE

* float encoding (NaN different in C impl ?)
* unicode encoding (deal with modified UTF-8)
* int/short encoding

* dec_ functions should return bytes read to simplify callers ?
* Move encode/decode to context from Message/Field as in .Net impl ?

* Date, DateTime fields


Questions:

Taxonomies:
* What to do if taxonomy in message, but not supplied on decode ?
* Is 0 a valid taxonomy ID ?  If there are ordinals and ID==0 then I should assume a taxonomy ?
