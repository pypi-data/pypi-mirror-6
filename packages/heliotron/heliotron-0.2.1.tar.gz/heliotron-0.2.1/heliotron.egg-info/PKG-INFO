Description: HELIOTRON
        =========
        
        Heliotron is a simple library that talks to Philips Hue light bridges through
        [a supported REST API][1]. It is currently a fairly rough work-in-progress.
        
        Several use cases were the primary motivation for this library:
        
        * I wanted a script that gradually changed color temperature of Philips Hue
          lighting on the same schedule as the popular [f.lux][2] utility. _(This is
          now available with the latest f.lux for Windows release.)_
        * I'd like to switch on a subset of my lights around sunset/dusk, if they're
          not already on, so that I don't come home to a pitch dark apartment.
        * The official Hue mobile apps won't let you store more than 3 active schedules
          on the bridge at a time, which is quite limited. This library provides the
          ability to write a simple script to switch or fade on a set of lights, and
          crontab it however you please.
