Description: ============================================
        codetools: code analysis and execution tools
        ============================================
        
        The codetools project includes packages that simplify meta-programming and
        help the programmer separate data from code in Python. This library contains
        classes that allow defining simple snippets, or "blocks", of Python code,
        analyze variable dependencies in the code block, and use these dependencies to
        construct or restrict an execution graph. These (restricted) code blocks can
        then be executed in any namespace. However, this project also provides a
        Traits-event-enhanced namespace, called a "context", which can be used in
        place of a vanilla namespace to allow actions to be performed whenever
        variables are assigned or retrieved from the namespace. This project is used
        as the foundation for the BlockCanvas project.
