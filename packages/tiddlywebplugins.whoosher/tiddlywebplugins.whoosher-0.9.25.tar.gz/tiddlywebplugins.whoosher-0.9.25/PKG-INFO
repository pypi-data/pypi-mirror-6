Description: 
        A TiddlyWeb[1] plugin which provides a Whoosh[2]-based indexing and
        search interface. Requires tiddlyweb 1.2.x.
        
        The plugin:
        
        * Depending on configuration replaces the search interface of the store
          that is in use (if any) or adds an additional search URI.
        * Automatically updates the index when a new tiddler is written to 
          the store.
        * Provides twanager commands for reindexing the entire store, and
          making command line searches of the index.
