DevAssistant is developer's best friend (right after coffee).

DevAssistant (http://devassistant.org) can help you with creating and setting up basic projects in various languages, installing dependencies, setting up environment etc. There are three main types of functionality provided:

- ``da crt`` - create new project from scratch
- ``da mod`` - take local project and do something with it (e.g. import it to Eclipse)
- ``da prep`` - prepare development environment for an upstream project or a custom task

DevAssistant is based on idea of per-{language/framework/...} "assistants" with hierarchical structure. E.g. you can run::

   $ da crt python django -n ~/myproject # sets up Django project named "myproject" inside your home dir
   $ da crt python flask -n ~/flaskproject # sets up Flask project named "flaskproject" inside your home dir
   $ da crt ruby rails -n ~/alsomyproject # sets up RoR project named "alsomyproject" inside your home dir

DevAssistant also allows you to work with a previously created project, for example import it to Eclipse::

   $ da mod eclipse # run in project dir or use -p to specify path

With DevAssistant, you can also prepare environment for developing upstream projects - either using project-specific assistants or using "custom" assistant for arbitrary projects (even those not created by DevAssistant)::

   $ da prep custom custom -u scm_url

**Warning:** The ``custom`` assistant executes custom pieces of code from
``.devassistant`` file of the project. Therefore you have to be extra careful
and use this **only with projects whose authors you trust**.

Last but not least, DevAssistant allows you to perform arbitrary tasks not related to a specific project:

.. code:: sh

  $ da task <TODO:NOTHING YET>
