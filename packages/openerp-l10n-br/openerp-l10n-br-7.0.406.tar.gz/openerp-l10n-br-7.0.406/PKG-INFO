Description: 
        
        Base module for the Brazilian localization
        ==========================================
        
        This module consists in:
        
         - Generic Brazilian chart of accounts
         - Brazilian taxes such as:
        
                - IPI
                - ICMS
                - PIS
                - COFINS
                - ISS
                - IR
                - IRPJ
                - CSLL
        
        The field tax_discount has also been added in the account.tax.template and 
        account.tax objects to allow the proper computation of some Brazilian VATs 
        such as ICMS. The chart of account creation wizard has been extended to 
        propagate those new data properly.
        
        It's important to note however that this module lack many implementations to 
        use OpenERP properly in Brazil. Those implementations (such as the electronic 
        fiscal Invoicing which is already operational) are brought by more than 15 
        additional modules of the Brazilian Launchpad localization project 
        https://launchpad.net/openerp.pt-br-localiz and their dependencies in the 
        extra addons branch. Those modules aim at not breaking with the remarkable 
        OpenERP modularity, this is why they are numerous but small. One of the 
        reasons for maintaining those modules apart is that Brazilian Localization 
        leaders need commit rights agility to complete the localization as companies 
        fund the remaining legal requirements (such as soon fiscal ledgers, 
        accounting SPED, fiscal SPED and PAF ECF that are still missing as September 
        2011). Those modules are also strictly licensed under AGPL V3 and today don't 
        come with any additional paid permission for online use of 'private modules'.
