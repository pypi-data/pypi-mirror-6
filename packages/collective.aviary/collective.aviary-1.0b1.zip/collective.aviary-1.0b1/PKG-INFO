        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add add the following to it::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.aviary
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.aviary`` and click the 'Activate' button.

        Usage
        -----
        
        The Aviary photo editor is a proprietary web widget that can be embedded in
        any website with just a few lines of Javascript, adding simple yet powerful
        image editing to an existing workflow. It is optimized for the latest versions
        of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer (IE9). The editor also works
        in mobile browsers, so it will function on handheld touch-screen devices, but
        it works best on tablets.
        
        ``collective.aviary`` replaces the standard **Transform** tab in native Image
        content type with a new one that invokes the Aviary photo editor.

            version.
        
        To-do list
        ----------
        
        - `Enable CORS`_
        - `Define available tools`_
        - `Add suport for plone.app.contenttypes`_
        
        .. _`Enable CORS`: https://github.com/collective/collective.aviary/issues/1
        .. _`Define available tools`: https://github.com/collective/collective.aviary/issues/4
        .. _`Add suport for plone.app.contenttypes`: https://github.com/collective/collective.aviary/issues/5
        
        Not entirely unlike
        ===================
        
        `Products.ImageEditor`_
            Adds an ``Image Editor`` link near the image widget allowing the user to
            rotate, flip, blur, compress, change contrast & brightness, sharpen, add
            drop shadows, crop, resize an image, save as, and apply sepia. Was the
            first attemp to enhance Plone image editing options but, let's face it,
            who wants to use a user interface à la `GIMP`_ these days?
        
        `collective.externalimageeditor`_
            Integrates Aviary, `FotoFlexer`_ and `Pixlr`_ into Plone. Unfortunately,
            `Aviary support was broken`_ when we test it and it was the only service
            we wanted to use. On the other side, creating a new package with support
            only for Aviary allow us better control of its features.
        
        `plone.app.imagecropping`_
            Allows images to be manually cropped using `Jcrop`_, a jQuery image
            cropping plugin. This package aims to be `THE cropping solution for Plone
            that just works` ™. Unfortunately, the package only use case is cropping
            on the scales given by `plone.app.imaging`_ and not on the original image.
