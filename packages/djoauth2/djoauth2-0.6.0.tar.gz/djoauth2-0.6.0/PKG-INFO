        What is DJOAuth2?
        -----------------
        
        DJOAuth2 is an implementation of a *sane* subset of the `OAuth 2`_
        specification, which is described by the `OAuth Website`_ as
        
          An open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard
          method from web, mobile and desktop applications.
        
        
        The goal of this implementation is to provide a well-structured Django
        application that can be easily installed to add OAuth 2.0 provider capability to
        existing projects. The official specification is broad, and allows for
        many different ways for clients and servers to interact with each other. This
        implementation is a secure subset of these interactions in order to make it as
        easy as possible to reap the benefits of OAuth without having to struggle with
        the more difficult parts of the spec.
        
        OAuth, and this implementation, are best suited to solving the following
        problems:
        
        * Allowing for fine-grained API control â€” you want your users to choose which
          applications have access to their data.
        * Acting as an authentication server, allowing other sites to "Log in with
          <your app>".
