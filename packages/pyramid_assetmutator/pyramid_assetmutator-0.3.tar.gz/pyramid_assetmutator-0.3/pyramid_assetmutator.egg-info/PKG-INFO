        Synopsis
        ================================================================================
        
        Pyramid AssetMutator provides simple and dynamic asset mutation (also known as
        compiling or piping) for your Pyramid_ applications.
        
        Inspired by other more powerful asset management packages, its goal is to
        provide a basic and straightforward mechanism for asset *compilation* (e.g.
        CoffeeScript/LESS), *minification* (e.g. jsmin), and *optimization* (e.g.
        pngcrush).
        
        As of version 0.3, it also adds experimental support for template language
        parsing (e.g. you could use view helpers like `request.route_url()` in your
        CoffeeScript by installing the `pyramid_jinja2` package and using
        application.coffee.jinja2 as the asset source filename).

        Known Issues and Limitations
        ================================================================================
        
        * Experimental support for Py3k/pypy.
        * Doesn't clean up after itself (compiled/mutated assets aren't removed
          automatically).
        * Mutator "commands" must print to stdout (see the documentation for more info).
        * Hopefully obvious, but you have to actually have the specified compiler
          command installed and accessible from your working path in order for it to
          work.
