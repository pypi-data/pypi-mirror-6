    ~ What is Flask?

      Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug
      and Jinja2.  It's intended for getting started very quickly
      and was developed with best intentions in mind.

    ~ What is Flask Async?

      It's a fork of Flask to run on Python 3.3+ using asyncio.  It supports
      both sync and async web applications.

    ~ What do I need?

      Just Jinja 2.4.  A fork of Werkzeug is included.

    ~ What does it look like?

      Pretty much what a Flask app looks like:

        from asyncio import coroutine, sleep
        from flask import Flask, request

        app = Flask(__name__)

        @app.route("/hello/<string:name>")
        @coroutine
        def say_hi(name):
            yield from sleep(2)
            return "it worked %s" % request.args.get("name", name)

        app.run()
