Description: # socket.io-announce in Python [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GetBlimp/socket.io-announce.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GetBlimp/socket.io-announce)
        
        Lightweight infrastructure broadcast for use with Socket.io RedisStore. This was ported from [dshaw/socket.io-announce](https://github.com/dshaw/socket.io-announce) a Node.js project. Thanks to [@dshaw](https://twitter.com/dshaw).
        
        
        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        pip install socket.io-announce
        ```
        
        ## Use anywhere in your stack, independent of other socket.io servers.
        
        ```python
        from announce import Announce
        
        announce = Announce()
        announce.emit('status', {'msg': 'Going down for maintenance in 15 minutes', 'countdown': 10000})
        ```
        
        ## Emit to all users.
        
        ```python
        announce.send('Hello, world!')
        announce.emit('quote', {'symbol':'APPL', 'price': 5000})
        ```
        
        ## Target socket.io rooms.
        
        ```python
        announce.send('Yoyo yo!', room='boardroom')
        announce.emit('tweet', {'id': '1', 'user': '@dshaw', 'text': 'Keeping things small...'}, room='nodeup')
        ```
        
        ## Target socket.io namespaces (with rooms too).
        
        ```python
        announce = Announce(namespace='/namespace')
        announce.emit('episode', {'url': 'http://www.nodeup.com/twentyfour'}, room='node up')
        ```
