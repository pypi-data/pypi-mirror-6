Getting started
******************

Requirements
===============

Currently, pywizard is developed under python 2.7 and not tested on other versions.
Tested OSes that have package-providers out of the box:

- Debian linux
- Ubuntu linux
- Centos linux
- Windows (viaChocolatey for packages)

.. note::
    If your os is not listed, you can add support for it by yourself. The only thing to implement is
    create package manager adapter, that is very easy to implement.

Installation
===============

As simple as::

    $ pip install pywizard==0.6-dev

or bit better::

    $ virtualenv myenv

    # on linux
    $ source myenv/bin/activate

    # on windows:
    $ myenv\Scripts\activate

    $ pip install pywizard==0.6-dev

In last case do not forgot to reactivate virtualenv before pywizard usage::

    # on linux
    $ source myenv/bin/activate

    # on windows:
    $ myenv\Scripts\activate


Or from sources (download sources from gtihub)::

    python setup.py install

Pywizard will install following dependencies as requirements:

- argparse
- jinja2
- distribute
- virtualenv


Hello, world!
===============

Create pywizard script "hello.py" somewhere (you may also use some other package instead)::

    from pywizard.api import *

    package('htop')

Execute (with DEBUG to see details)::

    $ pywizard --log-level=DEBUG apply hello.py

Now, you should have htop tool installed.

Rollback::

    $ pywizard --log-level=DEBUG apply hello.py --rollback

Now. htop is removed.

What's next?
=============

Tak a look at :ref:`provision-api`.

Explore other sections of this Documentation. And do not forgot to hit F5 time-to time,
as it's being heavily updated :)
