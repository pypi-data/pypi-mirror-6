Game Logic for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
===================================

This library should allow to easily create front-ends
for ultimate-tic-tac-toe game. It takes care of game rules,
validating the arguments, calling the right functions.

``run.lua`` is an example how this library can be used. To try out::

    tictactoelib/run.lua \
        tictactoelib/examples/dumb_player.lua \
        tictactoelib/examples/dumb_player.lua

The file takes two arguments: Lua files, which implement a player.
``tictactoelib/examples/dumb_player.lua`` is a demo player which marks a first
available slot.  Command-line example above makes it fight with itself.

See ``tictactoelib/examples/dumb_player.lua`` how to implement a player (it
could also be something that takes events from UI).

For human-readable game rules, see ultimate-tic-tac-toe's website_.

Compatibility
-------------

Library is written in pure Lua, is compatible with Lua5.1 and Lua5.2.
