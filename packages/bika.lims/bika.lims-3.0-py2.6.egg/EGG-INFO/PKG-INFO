        Long and correct way:
        
        1. Read https://plone.org/documentation/manual/installing-plone
        2. Read https://plone.org/documentation/kb/installing-add-ons-quick-how-to
        3. Install Plone and the "bika.lims" package
        
        Quick and dirty way (Linux or MacOSX):
        
        1. Download the "raw" install script from https://raw.github.com/bikalabs/Bika-LIMS/master/install.sh
        2. Run it (as root, using "sudo") to install in a subdirectory ./bika : "sudo bash ./install.sh" -- Optionally give another directory name as command line argument.
