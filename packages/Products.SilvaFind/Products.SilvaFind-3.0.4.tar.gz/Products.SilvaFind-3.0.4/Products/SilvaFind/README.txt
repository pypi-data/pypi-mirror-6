=========

Silva Find is an extension for `Silva`_ to allow easy creation of search forms
and result pages, both for users of the public site and for authors in the SMI.

Authors can add a *Silva Find* object anywhere and define which fields to
make searchable by end users of the public site, and/or which fields to
limit to a preset value. Authors also can determine which fields should be
displayed in the search results. All metadata set/fields are supported.

By default all possible custom search criterion fields and result fields are
available in the SMI. Besides that, the elements of all metadata sets are also
available as result fields. If these fields are indexed in the catalog, they
can also be used as search criterion fields. All available fields can be
enabled/disabled in the SMI.

Besides this behavior, SilvaFind also allows you to manually override the list
of search criteria.
