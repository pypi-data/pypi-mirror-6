Description: 
        
        This is the module for computing Procurements.
        ==============================================
        
        In the MRP process, procurements orders are created to launch manufacturing
        orders, purchase orders, stock allocations. Procurement orders are
        generated automatically by the system and unless there is a problem, the
        user will not be notified. In case of problems, the system will raise some
        procurement exceptions to inform the user about blocking problems that need
        to be resolved manually (like, missing BoM structure or missing supplier).
        
        The procurement order will schedule a proposal for automatic procurement
        for the product which needs replenishment. This procurement will start a
        task, either a purchase order form for the supplier, or a production order
        depending on the product's configuration.
