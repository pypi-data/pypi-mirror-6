Description: =================================================
        chssh -- Interactive ssh and scp for chef server
        =================================================
        
        Inspired by ec2-ssh from instagram, this uses the pychef library to allow you to address your hosts by their chef node name instead of the dns name.
        
        This differs from `knife ssh` because these tools operate with interactive shells, and are meant for working with 1 node at a time.
        
        Prerequisities
        --------------
        
        You need to have an installed and configured chef client on your machine. The code uses the pychef autoconfigure() to discover and load the chef configuration
        
        Usage
        -----
        
                ``chssh node1``   # ssh to chef node node1
        
                ``chssh user@node1``  # ssh as user to chef node node1
        
                ``chscp file user@node1:path`` # scp file to chef node node1
        
                ``chscp user@node1:path`` . # scp file from chef node node1
        
        Enjoy!
