hobonickels is an APACHE licensed library written in Python designed to provide a simple to use API for the HoboNickels cryptocurrency.

## More about HoboNickels:

HoboNickels is a cryptographic currency, similar to Bitcoin, that is designed to make online transactions easy and efficient.

HoboNickels wallet clients are being actively developed and improved upon. HoboNickels (HBN) is an extremely fast and efficient crypto-currency. With a Proof of Work block time of 30 seconds coupled with fast Proof of Stake, it is pushing to be one of the fastest coins available. The 2-5% Proof of Stake is also one of the most generous staking algorithms released. The stake is designed to keep the inflation rate from getting out of control, with the % of stake decreasing as more people stake the coin. HoboNickels has the added security of a Proof of Stake coin with the addition of security features like Automated Block Checkpoints. HoboNickels are the first coin to use Multi-Wallet functionality.
