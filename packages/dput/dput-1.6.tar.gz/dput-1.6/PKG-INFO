Description: dput-ng
        -------
        
        dput-ng is a from-scratch refresh of the old `dput(1)` command. This tool is
        used (at some point) to aid with the act of uploading a package to an archive.
        
        dput-ng aims to be compatible with the old `dput(1)` config files, while
        adding additional features for better sanity checking, and designed in an
        extensible way.
