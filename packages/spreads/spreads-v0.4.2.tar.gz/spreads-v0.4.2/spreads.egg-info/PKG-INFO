        *spreads* is a tool that aims to streamline your book scanning workflow.
        It takes care of every step: Setting up your capturing devices, handling
        the capturing process, downloading the images to your machine,
        post-processing them and finally assembling a variety of output formats.
        
        Along the way you can always fine-tune the auto-generated results either
        by supplying arguments or changing the configuration beforehand, or by
        inspecting the output and applying your modifications.
        
        *spreads* is meant to be fully customizable. This means, `adding support for
        new devices` is made as painless as possible. You can also hook into any of the
        *spread* commands by implementing one of the available `plugin hooks` or even
        `implement your own custom sub-commands`.
        
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        First, make sure you have installed all of the requirements (see below).
        Once this is done, *spreads* can be easily installed from PyPi::
        
            $ pip install spreads
        
        To select your desired plugins and configure your devices::
        
            $ spread configure
        
        *spreads* offers an interactive wizard that takes you from a physical book
        to a digitized version in one single workflow with minimal user input::
        
            $ spread wizard ~/my_scanning_project
        
        
        Features
        --------
        * Shoot with both cameras **simultaneously**, directly storing the images
          in a single directory on your computer in the right order.
        * Automatically rotate the images and optionally adjust the white balance
          (if a gray card has been used during shooting).
        * Create a ScanTailor project file that the user can customize as desired.
        * Generate PDF and DJVU files with hidden text layers
        * Interactive Wizard-Mode that handles the full workflow from image
          capturing to post-processing, either from the command-line or via graphical
          interface.
