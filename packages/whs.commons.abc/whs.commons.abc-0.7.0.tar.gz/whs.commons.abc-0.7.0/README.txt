This is ABC package, containing some base classes for (de)serialization, type
registration and session managment.


If you want to develop this, remember to switch to branch develop.

On this branch main package is named whs_dev.
If it wasn't, other installed packages would be shadowed by local package whs.

When merging develop to master, remember to change whs_dev to whs.
