Terminus
========

Terminus is a simple Python interface used to manipulate the
`/etc/network/interfaces` file on Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian-based Linux
distributions.

Support for modifying the interface-specific files on Red Hat-based
distributions, including Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific Linux, and
Fedora are forthcoming as well.
