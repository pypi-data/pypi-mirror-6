Description: rtyaml: Round-trippable YAML
        ============================
        
        Primary author: Joshua Tauberer <http://razor.occams.info>

        This module provides wrappers around ``pyyaml`` to set sane defaults:
        
        * field order in dicts is preserved when writing out objects that were read in by this library
        * saner output defaults are set
        * any comment block found at the very beginning of the file when loading YAML is preserved when writing it back out
        
        Usage::
        
           import rtyaml
           stuff = rtyaml.load(open("myfile.yaml"))
           # ...do things to stuf...
           rtyaml.dump(stuff, open("myfile.yaml", "w"))
        
        As in the underlying pyyaml library, ``load`` accepts a byte string containing YAML, a Unicode string containing YAML, an open binary file object, or an open text file object. Also, the second argument to ``dump`` is optional and if omitted the function returns the YAML in a string.
        
        Dependencies
        -------------
        
        * pyyaml (in Ubuntu, the ``python-yaml`` or ``python3-yaml`` package)
        * libyaml (in Ubuntu, the ``libyaml-0-2`` package plus, at install time only, ``libyaml-dev``)
        
        This package works in both Python 2 and 3.
        
        Details
        -------
        
        This library does the following:
        
        * Uses the native libyaml CSafeLoader and CDumper for both speed and trustable operations.
        * Parses mappings as OrderedDicts so that the field order remains the same when dumping the file later.
        * Writes unicode strings without any weird YAML tag. They just appear as strings. Output is UTF-8 encoded, and non-ASCII characters appear as Unicode without escaping.
        * Writes mappings and lists in the expanded (one per line) format, which is nice when the output is going in version control.
        * Modifies the string quote rules so that any string made up of digits is serialized with quotes. (The defaults will omit quotes for octal-ish strings like "09" that are invalid octal notation.)
        * Serializes null values as the tilde, since "null" might be confused for a string-typed value.
        * If a block comment appears at the start of the file (i.e. one or more lines starting with a '#', write back out the commend if the same object is written with rtyaml.dump().)
