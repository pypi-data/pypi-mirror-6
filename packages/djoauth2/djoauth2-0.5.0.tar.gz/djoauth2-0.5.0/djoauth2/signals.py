From http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.4 :

    If a refresh token is compromised and subsequently used by both the
    attacker and the legitimate client, one of them will present an
    invalidated refresh token, which will inform the authorization server of
    the breach.

This is the signal raised in that case. You may listen to this signal like
this:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from djoauth2.signals import refresh_token_used_after_invalidation

    @receiver(refresh_token_used_after_invalidation)
    def invalidated_refresh_token_use_callback(sender, access_token, request):
      # ... code to alert the client in some way goes here.

"""

refresh_token_used_after_invalidation = Signal(
    providing_args=['access_token', 'request'])
