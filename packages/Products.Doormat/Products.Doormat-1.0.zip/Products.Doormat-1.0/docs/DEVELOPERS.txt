UML deprecation notice
----------------------

This product's content types were created with ArchGenXML (AGX), a tool to
generate code from a UML model. AGX is no longer widely used, since Dexterity
content types have replaced Archetypes as the default content type story.

Since version 0.9, this package has tests, for which plone.app.testing is
used. Making AGX work with this doesn't seem to be worth the trouble.
Therefore the UML model and everything that's related to it was removed.

You'll still find the UML and its documentation in a pre-0.9 version of the
code.
