**WebHelpers2** is the successor to the widely-used WebHelpers_ utility
functions.  It narrows the focus to a core set of utilities that are most
widely used, relevant to Pyramid and other current frameworks, and easiest to
maintain and port to Python 3. In particular it keeps the HTML builder and HTML
tag functions, and most of the text-processing, number formatting, statistics,
and date functions, See :ref:`migrate` if you're currently using WebHelpers or
betas 1 - 3.

**Version 2.0b5** is the Python 3 port. It's tested on 3.3.4 and 2.7.4, and
should also work on 3.2 (see caveats below) and 2.6. The remaining work is to
refactor the 'html' subpackage.

WebHelpers2 depends on MarkupSafe_ and six_, and can use Unidecode_ if it's
installed.  An extensive test suite for PyTest is included.  For
support/questions/patches, please use the pylons-discuss_ mailing list.
