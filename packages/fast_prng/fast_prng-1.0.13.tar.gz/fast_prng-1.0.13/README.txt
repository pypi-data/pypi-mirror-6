This module is an extension of a faster Pseudo Random Number Generator
originally designed in C. It mimics the functions: random.exponential, 
random.normal, and random.random_sample found in numpy, while offering 
considerable speedup. Please see https://bitbucket.org/cdmcfarland/fast_prng 
for details on the original project.
