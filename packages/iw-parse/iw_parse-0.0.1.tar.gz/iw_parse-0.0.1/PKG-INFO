Description: iw_parse
        ========
        
        Parse the output of iwlist scan to get the name, address, quality, channel, and encryption type of all networks broadcasting within your Wireless NIC's reach.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ```bash
        iwlist <INTERFACE_NAME> scan | ./iw_parse
        ```
        
        Replace `<INTERFACE_NAME>` with the system name for your wireless NIC. It is usually something like `wlan0`. The command `iwconfig` will list all of your network interfaces.
        
        Example:
        
        ```bash
        iwlist wlan0 scan | ./iw_parse
        ```
