Description: Mayo: Download source control URIs
        ==================================
        
        The main use of Mayo is being able to download repositories from a URI
        that specifies what version control system (VCS) is being used:
        
        ::
        
            import mayo
        
            mayo.fetch("git+https://github.com/mwilliamson/mayo.git", "/tmp/mayo")
            print open("/tmp/mayo/README.md").read()
        
        Mayo can also be used as a script:
        
        ::
        
            mayo fetch git+https://github.com/mwilliamson/mayo.git /tmp/mayo
        
        Specific commits can be selected by appending a hash to the URI,
        followed by the name of the commit:
        
        ::
        
            mayo.fetch("git+https://github.com/mwilliamson/mayo.git#74d69b4", "/tmp/mayo")
        
        At the moment, git and hg URIs are supported.
