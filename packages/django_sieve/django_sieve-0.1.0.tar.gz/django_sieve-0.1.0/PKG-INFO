        Filter user-data based on multiple criteria.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        We are at the cheeseshop: ::
        
        	pip install django_sieve
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To use django_sieve in a project:
        
        1. Include it in INSTALLED_APPS in your settings file.
        
        2. Define a sieve model. A sieve model is the control for defining the filtering criteria for user data. For instance, in our example, we have a bookstore in which a user can subscribe to all the books from a particular author or all the books from a particular publisher. In this case, his book list need to only contain books from the publisher and author that he has chosen. In order to do this, we define a sieve model like so: ::
        
        	class Sieve(models.Model):
        		user = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
        		publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher)
        		author = models.ForeignKey(Author)
        
        3. Declare your project-wide sieve model in `settings.py`. For instance, if the sieve model is called Sieve and resides in the bookstore app: ::
        
        	SIEVE_MODEL = 'bookstore.Sieve'
        
        4. Use `SieveManager` as the ModelManager for all the models in your project that you want to filter based on the criteria defined in the sieve model: ::
        
        	class Author(models.Model):
        		first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        		last_name = models.CharField(max_length=40)
        		email = models.EmailField()
        		objects = SieveManager()
        
        5. Use the `sieve` method to define your queryset in your views like so: ::
        
        	class BookView(ListView):
        		queryset = Book.objects.sieve(user=request.user)
        
        That is all. Site-wide filtering of user-data based on pre-defined criteria without having to write queries for all the views. Please be wary of performance issues though - in our experience, django-sieve works for 90% cases especially when you need to bring everything up for a quick demo. However, as your site matures and the number of users increase, you may want to invest in profiling your views and hand-crafting these queries when and where required.
