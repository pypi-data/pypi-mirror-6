===========

*scikit-nano* is a python toolkit for nano-science.  Its primary utility is
generating nano-structure data (i.e., atomic coordinates) for the following
nano-structure materials:

    * Graphene:

        * Single layer graphene
        * bi-layer graphene with layers rotated relative to each other
        * :math:`N`-layer graphene

    * Nanotubes:

        * Single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs)
        * SWNT *bundles*
        * Multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs)
        * MWNT *bundles*

It currently supports saving structure data in the following formats:

    * `xyz`
    * LAMMPS `data`

Secondary to its structure generating functions are its
*structure analysis tools* facilitated by its built-in
abstract data structures for representing atoms including:

    * nearest-neighbor analysis
    * ...
