.PP
Waiting for a port to become available is useful for when services are not immediately available after their init scripts return - which is true of certain Java application servers. It is also useful when starting guests with the \fIvirt\fR module and needing to pause until they are ready. This module can also be used to wait for a file to be available on the filesystem or with a regex match a string to be present in a file.
