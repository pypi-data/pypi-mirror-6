Working on stsci-python
--

svn checkout  https://svn.stsci.edu/svn/ssb/stsci_python/stsci_python/trunk  stsci_python

cd stsci_python

./checkout.sh
	# checks out all the packages that are included in stsci_python

./install.sh --home ~/py
	# installs all the packages

cd package_dir
	# there is a separate subversion tree for each package, but
	# they are now all checked out here.  Work on it as you 
	# normally would.

	python setup.py install --home ~/py

	vi file.py
	svn commit

After you have been working on it for a long time and you want to
clean some of it up, the normal way is "rm -rf stsci_python" and
do a fresh checkout


If you only want to work on one particular package, you do not have
to check out stsci_python or any of the other packages.  Just check
out the package you need:

svn checkout  https://svn.stsci.edu/svn/ssb/stsci_python/acstools/trunk acstools
python setup.py install --home ~/py
