0.9.5   20131231 Add replace_lines() function, enhance unit tests, 
        added an exactmatch option on _find_line_OBJ().  Updated code 
        copyright to include 2014
0.9.4   20130814 Add Python3 compliance; other minor tweaks
0.9.3   20130511 Added methods to IOSCfgLine: __eq__(), __hash__(), __lt__(), 
        __gt__(), as well as simplifying several other methods.  Misc code
        maintenance...
0.9.2   20130509 Add find_children_w_parents() method... tidy up unit-tests
0.9.1   20121231 Improve docs with numpydoc and intersphinx links.  Add
        more examples / doctests.  Renamed internal CiscoConfParse methods
        with a leading _ to make Sphinx documentation more intuitive...
0.9.0   20121230 Add RST documentation into the archives and fix more build 
        issues
0.8.6   20121230 Fix packaging problems introduced when I switched to a native
        mercurial repository (examples/* and configs/* were not automatically
        packaged in the .egg / .tar.gz anymore...)
0.8.5   20121229 - Added custom comment delimiters that were in the 0.8.3a private 
        build.  Converted the unicode backslash to a true unicode instance.
0.8.4   20121229 - Add doctests, code maintenance, and more documentation fixes.
        Improved examples/req_cfgspec_all_diff.py and 
        examples/req_cfgspec_excl_diff.py.
0.8.3   20091016 - Documentation updates.  PEP8 formatting
0.8.2   20090808 - Fixed a fatal crash in find_blocks()
0.8.1   20090719 - Code reorganization.  Fixed a bad RuntimeError.  Promoted to
        production-quality at this point
0.8.0   20071011 - Removed residual internal debugging from the CiscoPassword
        class.  Added an 'ignore_ws' options to all public methods, except
	req_cfgspec_excl_diff; this option will make the method's matches 
	ignore whitespace differences (useful in some CatOS configurations).  
	After much deliberation, I have removed the explicit 'False' return 
	values for methods that do not match; instead I am returning an empty 
	list (which will test False).  Apologies for breaking any existing 
	code, but I decided against leaving beta with this behavior.  Removed
	all sys.exit(0) statements in favor of raising a RuntimeError.

0.7.5   20070804 - Fixed a bug in the parse() method, which was associating
        grandchildren as children of the grandparent.   Added unit tests.

0.7.0   20070803 - Added an optional parameter to the find_lines(), 
        find_children(), find_all_children(), and find_blocks() methods.  This
	parameter will allow the user to specify whether he wants an "exact"
	match or a normal regex match.  Also fixed a bug that broke parsing
	of configs with an indented line at the very end.

0.6.8   20070802 - Ported fixes to the CiscoPassword class from the 
        cisco_decrypt package.  Notably, there were crashes when it was called
	with certain unencrypted passwords.

0.6.7   20070801 - Fixed bug where some methods didn't return False when no 
        diffs were found

0.6.6   20070730 - Added password decryption options to the command-line help
        menu.  Modified all diff functions to return False if no diffs are found

0.6.5   20070728 - Fixed another CiscoPassword bug. Added warning if 
        CiscoPassword decryption fails.  Added command-line functionality for 
	improved interoperability with other languages (and shell-usage if 
	you like).

0.6.1   20070726 - Cosmetic restructuring of code

0.6.0   20070721 - Revised APIs.  Existing APIs should be stable now
