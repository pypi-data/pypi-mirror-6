Description: A Python library to control and monitor LIFX bulbs. Also provides a workaround
        for users having issues with controlling LIFX bulbs on their network.
        
        GitHub: https://github.com/derkarnold/pylifx
        
        Originally written to allow the LIFX bulb to work in non-standard networks, but
        it is growing to be much more.
        
        Huge thanks to Kevin Bowman(magicmonkey) and others for the lifxjs project on GitHub:
            https://github.com/magicmonkey/lifxjs/
        
        Without their work on the lifxjs project, this one would not have been possible.
        
        Current features:
        
          * Allows the LIFX bulb smartphone app to work by "faking" a bulb and relaying
            commands to the real one (see examples/bridge.py).
          * Gives the ability to display the contents of LIFX messages coming through.
            ** Huge thanks to magicmonkey and the lifxjs project for their hard work on
            working out the LIFX protocol.
          * The ability to run "scenes" - provide a dictionary of times and colours and
            the library will do the rest (see examples/sunrise.py).
        
        Upcoming features:
        
          * Auto-discovery of bulbs (yes, should have been there already).
          * Support for more than one bulb per bridge (waiting on another bulb to arrive).
        
        Two common issues with installing:
        
          * Linux users - ensure you have python-dev installed (for the netifaces package).
          * Windows users - install the pre-built binaries for your python distribution
            using the links in the following URL: http://alastairs-place.net/projects/netifaces/
            (The section is just above the start of the Changelog section).
