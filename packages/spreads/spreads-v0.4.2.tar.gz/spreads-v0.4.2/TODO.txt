- Raise minimum version for remote capture

General
=======
- Clean up GUI code, it's an unholy mess...

    * more specific: what should a method *do*/*effects*
    * less mock objects
    * better coverage
- Reinstate 'combine' plugin as a custom subcommand that expects 'odd' and
  'even' directories in project path

Plugin ideas
