Description: pytrie is a Python library implementing a trie data structure.
        
        Trie data structure, also known as radix or prefix tree, is an ordered
        tree associating keys to values where all the descendants of a node
        have a common prefix (associated with that node).
        
        The trie module contains Trie, CharTrie and StringTrie classes each
        implementing a mutable mapping interface, i.e. interface of the
        dictionary.  As such, in most circumstances, Trie could be used as
        a drop-in replacement for a dict.  Obviously the prefix nature of the
        data structure is what gives it its strengths.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - A full mutable mapping implementation.
        
        - Supports iterating over as well as deleting a subtrie.
        
        - Supports prefix checking as well as shortest and longest prefix
          look-up.
        
        - Extensible for any kind of user-defined keys.
