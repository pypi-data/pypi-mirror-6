Version 1.1 - 2013-12-22
=========================
Original release made use of the lsqfit package in the testing.
This package is quite useful in conjunction with vegas (for the gvar module)
but it is not required. The testing and examples now work without 
lsqfit present, which was the original intent. See discussion at the 
end of the Tutorial about the role of lsqfit.

Version 1.0 - 2013-12-21
==========================
This is the first version of a new implementation
of the vegas algorithm for adaptive multidimensional
Monte Carlo integration. It is written in Python/Cython
and features a significantly improved algorithm
relative to earlier versions of vegas. In particular
it now uses two adaptive strategies instead of one.
