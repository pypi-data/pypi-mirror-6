Description: esoreader
        =========
        
        A python module for reading \*.eso files generated by EnergyPlus
        
        The eso files generated by EnergyPlus contains a data dictionary, which
        describes the values reported by EnergyPlus. The list of values reported
        depends on the simulation input file, specifically the Output:Variable
        objects. EnergyPlus can output the same variable at different
        frequencies and for different "keys", which are for instance surfaces or
        equipment names.
        
        Following the data dictionary is a list of output variable values for
        each of the configured variable coordinates.
        
        The output of the esoreader module is therefore a data dictionary object
        that contains a mapping of variable "coordinates" (grouping of reporting
        frequency, key and variable name) to the index used by EnergyPlus and a
        data object, which essentially just maps that index to the timeseries
        data.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        ::
        
            import esoreader
        
            PATH_TO_ESO = r'/Path/To/EnergyPlus/Output/eplusout.eso'
            dd, data = esoreader.read(PATH_TO_ESO)
            frequency, key, variable = dd.find_variable('Zone Ventilation Total Heat Loss Energy')[0]
            idx = dd.index[frequency, key, variable]
            time_series = data[idx]
