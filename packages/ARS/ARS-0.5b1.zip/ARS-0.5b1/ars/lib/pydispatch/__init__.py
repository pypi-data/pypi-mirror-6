# PyDispatcher provides the Python programmer with a
# multiple-producer-multiple-consumer signal-registration and routing
# infrastructure for use in multiple contexts. The mechanism of PyDispatcher
# started life as a highly rated recipe in the Python Cookbook. The project
# aims to include various enhancements to the recipe developed during use in
# various applications.
#
# It is primarily maintained by Mike Fletcher. A
# derivative of the project provides the Django web framework's "signal" system.
