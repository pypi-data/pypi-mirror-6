python-bitcoin
==============

A modular, extensible implementation of the Bitcoin data structures and internal protocol in Python. Additionally includes an RPC proxy for communicating with a running bitcoind instance. When possible, Pythonic idioms are preferred over legacy bitcoin structures. Forked from the pynode project managed by Jeff Garzik.
