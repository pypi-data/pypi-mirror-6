.SH NAME
nuitka-python \- the Python compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nuitka-python
[\fIoptions\fR] \fImain_module.py\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show program's version number and exit
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-exe\fR
Create a standalone executable instead of a compiled
extension module. Default is on.
.TP
\fB\-\-python\-version\fR=\fIPYTHON_VERSION\fR
Major version of Python to be used, one of '2.6',
\&'2.7', '3.2', or '3.3'.
.TP
\fB\-\-python\-debug\fR
Use debug version or not. Default uses what you are
using to run Nuitka, most likely a non\-debug version.
.TP
\fB\-\-python\-flag\fR=\fIPYTHON_FLAGS\fR
Python flags to use. Default uses what you are using
to run Nuitka, this enforces a specific mode. These
are options that also exist to standard Python
executable. Currently supported "\-S" (alias nosite).
Default empty.
.TP
\fB\-\-windows\-target\fR
Force compilation for windows, useful for crosscompilation. Defaults False.
.TP
\fB\-\-windows\-disable\-console\fR
When compiling for windows, disable the console
window. Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-lto\fR
Use link time optimizations if available and usable
(g++ 4.6 and higher). Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-clang\fR
Enforce the use of clang (clang 3.0 or higher).
Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-mingw\fR
Enforce the use of MinGW on Windows. Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR N, \fB\-\-jobs\fR=\fIN\fR
Specify the allowed number of parallel C++ compiler
jobs. Defaults to the system CPU count.
.TP
\fB\-\-warn\-implicit\-exceptions\fR
Given warnings for implicit exceptions detected at
compile time.
.TP
\fB\-\-standalone\fR, \fB\-\-portable\fR
Enable standalone mode in build. This allows you to
transfer the created binary to other machines without
it relying on an existing Python installation. It
implies these options: "\-\-exe \fB\-\-python\-flag\fR=\fI\-S\fR
\fB\-\-recurse\-all\fR \fB\-\-recurse\-stdlib\fR". Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-icon\fR=\fIICON_PATH\fR
Add executable icon (windows only).
.SS Control the recursion into imported modules with '\-\-exe' mode:
.BR
.TP
\fB\-\-recurse\-stdlib\fR
Also descend into imported modules from standard
library. Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-recurse\-none\fR
When \fB\-\-recurse\-none\fR is used, do not descend into any
imported modules at all, overrides all other recursion
options. Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-recurse\-all\fR, \fB\-\-recurse\-on\fR
When \fB\-\-recurse\-all\fR is used, attempt to descend into
all imported modules. Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-recurse\-to\fR=\fIMODULE\fR/PACKAGE
Recurse to that module, or if a package, to the whole
package. Can be given multiple times. Default empty.
.TP
\fB\-\-recurse\-not\-to\fR=\fIMODULE\fR/PACKAGE
Do not recurse to that module, or if a package, to the
whole package in any case, overrides all other
options. Can be given multiple times. Default empty.
.TP
\fB\-\-recurse\-plugins\fR=\fIMODULE\fR/PACKAGE, \fB\-\-recurse\-directory\fR=\fIMODULE\fR/PACKAGE
Recurse into that directory, no matter if it's used by
the given main program in a visible form. Overrides
all other options. Can be given multiple times.
Default empty.
.SS Immediate execution after compilation:
.BR
.TP
\fB\-\-execute\fR
Execute immediately the created binary (or import the
compiled module). Defaults to on.
.TP
\fB\-\-execute\-with\-pythonpath\fR, \fB\-\-keep\-pythonpath\fR
When immediately executing the created binary
(\fB\-\-execute\fR), don't reset PYTHONPATH. When all modules
are successfully included, you ought to not need
PYTHONPATH anymore.
.SS Dump options for internal tree:
.BR
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\-xml\fR
Dump the final result of optimization as XML, then
exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\-tree\fR
Dump the final result of optimization as text, then
exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-display\-tree\fR
Display the final result of optimization in a GUI,
then exit.
.SS Code generation choices:
.BR
.TP
\fB\-\-improved\fR, \fB\-\-enhanced\fR
Allow minor devitations from CPython behaviour, e.g.
better tracebacks, which are not really incompatible,
but different.
.TP
\fB\-\-code\-gen\-no\-statement\-lines\fR
Statements shall have their line numbers set. Disable
this for less precise exceptions and slightly faster
code. Not recommended. Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-optimization\fR
Disable all unnecessary optimizations on Python level.
Defaults to off.
.SS Output directory choices:
.BR
.TP
\fB\-\-output\-dir\fR=\fIDIRECTORY\fR
Specify where intermediate and final output files
should be put. DIRECTORY will be populated with C++
files, object files, etc. Defaults to current
directory.
.TP
\fB\-\-remove\-output\fR
Removes the build directory after producing the module
or exe file. Defaults to off.
.SS Debug features:
.BR
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Executing all self checks possible to find errors in
Nuitka, do not use for production. Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-unstripped\fR, \fB\-\-no\-strip\fR, \fB\-\-unstriped\fR
Keep debug info in the resulting object file for
better gdb interaction. Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-trace\-execution\fR
Traced execution output, output the line of code
before executing it. Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-c\fR++\-only
Compile the would\-be regenerated source file. Allows
compiling edited C++ files with the C++ compiler for
quick debugging changes to the generated source.
Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-experimental\fR
Use features declared as 'experimental'. May have no
effect if no experimental features are present in the
code. Defaults to off.
.SS Tracing features:
.BR
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-scons\fR
Operate Scons in non\-quiet mode, showing the executed
commands. Defaults to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-progress\fR
Provide progress information and statistics. Defaults
to off.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
Output details of actions take, esp. in optimizations.
Can become a lot. Defaults to off.
