Description: *Remember that time where you tried to remake a figure for your paper and
        couldn't seem to get the same results? We've all been there. Well not
        anymore!*
        
        This module monkey patches the ``savefig`` command from `matplotlib
        <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ and inserts your current git commit hash into
        the metadata of the saved file. Currently it supports PNG and PDF figures.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First, install the module `from PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/savefig>`_::
        
            pip install savefig
        
        or `from source <https://github.com/dfm/savefig>`_::
        
            git clone https://github.com/dfm/savefig.git
            cd savefig
            python setup.py install
        
        Then in all your code just add the following lines before importing matplotlib::
        
            from savefig import monkey_patch
            monkey_patch()
        
        To read the metadata from an existing image file, run::
        
            python -m savefig /path/to/figure.png
