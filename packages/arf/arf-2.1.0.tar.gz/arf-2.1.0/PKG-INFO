Description: 
        Library for reading and writing Advanced Recording Format files. ARF files
        are HDF5 files used to store audio and neurophysiological recordings in a
        rational, hierarchical format. Data are organized around the concept of an
        entry, which is a set of data channels that all start at the same time.
        Supported data types include sampled data and event data (i.e. spike times).
        Requires h5py (at least 2.2) and numpy (at least 1.3).
