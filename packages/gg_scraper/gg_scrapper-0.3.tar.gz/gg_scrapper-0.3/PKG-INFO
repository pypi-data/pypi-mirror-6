Description: 
        A small script as a replacement of `the old PHP script`_ for downloading messages stored in the black hole of the Google Groups.

        I would never start without an inspiration from the comment_ on my previous post on the theme of locked down nature of Google Groups.

        Of course pull requests (especially for testing with python 2.*) are more than welcome in the same places as well.  Currently all development is done with Python 3.3.
