Here's how to release a new minor version X.Y.0:

    1. Update CHANGES.txt; changes showing on top as "dev" should now
       show as X.Y.0, with the current date. If no changes show, find
       them from the VCS and add them. Commit.

    2. Create a branch:

          git checkout -b X.Y

    3. In setup.py, in the call to "setup()", change the value of
       version so that it has the value "X.Y.0" (should be "dev"
       before you change it).

    4. Commit:

          git commit -a -m "Version X.Y.0"

    5. Create a tag:

          git tag X.Y.0

    6. Push the new branch and the new tag:

          git push origin X.Y
          git push origin X.Y.0

    7. Create a new release in github.

    8. Upload to pypi:
    
          ./setup.py sdist upload
