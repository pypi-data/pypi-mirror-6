Description: =======
        docgrep
        =======
        
        Like ``grep``, but only searches through docstrings (in Python code).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        From pip::
        
            $ pip install --upgrade docgrep
        
        
        Example
        =======
        
        ::
        
            $ docgrep 'Python 3.4' .
            ./asyncio/futures.py:113: """This class is *almost* compatible with concurrent.futures.Future.
        
                Differences:
        
                - result() and exception() do not take a timeout argument and
                  raise an exception when the future isn't done yet.
        
                - Callbacks registered with add_done_callback() are always called
                  via the event loop's call_soon_threadsafe().
        
                - This class is not compatible with the wait() and as_completed()
                  methods in the concurrent.futures package.
        
                (In Python 3.4 or later we may be able to unify the implementations.)
