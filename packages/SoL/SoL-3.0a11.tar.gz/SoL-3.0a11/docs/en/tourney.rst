Tourney management
==================

.. figure:: tourney.png

   Tourney management

This is the core window of the application and is composed by four *panels*. On the left
there's the `competitors`_ one, where you can subscribe new players, retire existing ones or
rearrange them in teams if season's :guilabel:`players per team` is bigger than 1 (first turn
only). On the right there's the `ranking`_ panel, where you can see the current ranking,
possibly grouped by nationality. At the bottom there's the `first turn`_ view that let you
alter the random combination generated for the first turn. The remaining space in the middle is
dedicated to the `matches`_.

The three panels on the borders can be minimized, thus maximizing the space for the
matches_. In particular, the one on the left and the one at the bottom are mainly used only
just before and just after the first turn is created.

.. note:: General and federal rankings are basically summaries of a set of tourneys. Since they
          are computed using the **final prize** of each competitor (possibly multiplied by the
          tourney's *prize factor*), obviously **only** *prized* tourneys are taken into
          account.

          This also means that if a tourney is being inserted "after the fact", just to
          introduce its scoring into the general rankings, details about single rounds may be
          omitted. In this case follow these steps:

          1. insert the list of competitors
          2. confirm the changes
          3. assign final prizes, with the :guilabel:`prize` button in the ranking_ panel: this
             will show the :guilabel:`final prize` column
          4. manually change each competitor's final prize, accordingly to the effective
             tourney's ranking
          5. confirm the changes

.. _competitors panel:

.. figure:: competitors_1.png
   :figclass: float-right

   Competitors panel

Competitors
-----------

This panel is used to start a new tourney: using *drag&drop* you can either insert new players
or rearrange them in teams, as shown here.

.. figure:: competitors_2.png
   :figclass: float-left

   Adjusted teams

You can see that there are three incomplete teams with only two players instead of four: you
can drag single players from one team to another, or adding new ones dragging from the
:ref:`players <players management>` window. The :guilabel:`add...` button brings up that
window, showing only players **not yet** associated with the tourney.

The next figure shows that one team was completed by dragging both players of another team onto
it: the emptied team will be deleted.

One team remains incomplete: this does not have any impact on the succeding operations,
although it would be quite strange.

.. hint:: Players may be removed from the panel by dragging them and dropping over any empty
          space (the scrollbar, when the panel is full): the icon associated to the drag
          operation will reflect the case.

It's not possible to change the composition of a team once the first round has been played, for
obvious reasons.

.. figure:: retire.png

   Retire confirmation

A competitor may be retired by double-clicking it and confirming the action: this means that he
won't participate to further games. He will show up in the ranking, though.

.. topic:: Teams

   From the application point of view, the number of players that compose a single competitor
   does **not** make any difference. Each game involves *two* distinct *competitors*, no matter
   how many players are grouped in each one, each group represent a *single* entity.

   When organizing a teamed championship, beware that any team is determined by the people
   assigned to it **and** by their ordering: the team `John and Paul` is **different** from the
   one composed by `Paul and John`, that is the same guys but in different order! This is where
   the `duplicate tourney` action is very useful.

   .. note:: The :guilabel:`nationality` of a team is determined by that of its first player,
             so order *matters*: be sure to drag in players in the right sequence.


First turn
----------

.. figure:: firstturn.png

   First turn recombination

The `arbiter` may decide that the random combination generated by the application for the first
turn is not adeguate and some manual intervention is required. In this window, enabled **only**
before the first turn is actually played, you can drag&drop competitors around, swapping them
as desired.

Even the association of matches with the carrom boards is random, for the first round. From the
second on ``SoL`` tries to give a different board for each turn to a given player, following
ranking order. This guarantees that top players will preferably play on different low-numbered
boards, while weaker ones will use high-numbered boards, possibly repeatedly, in particular
when the number of players (and thus the number of tables) is very low.


.. figure:: deleteturn.png
   :figclass: float-right

   Deletion of turns

Matches
-------

The middle panel is where most of the activity happens: here you iteratively create next turn,
insert its results and compute the new ranking.

Usually only the most recent turn is *expanded*, to save space.

Of course, only the **last** turn is editable, that is, you cannot alter previous rounds
results. If something went wrong and you need to rectify any previous score, you must *delete*
the last turn (or even more than one, should that have any sense at all), make the change and
regenerate the new turn.


.. figure:: rankingbynation.png
   :figclass: float-right

   Ranking grouped by nationality

Ranking
-------

Whenever you change and commit the results of the last round the ranking is automatically
recomputed and shown here. The :guilabel:`prize` column is usually hidden until *prize giving*.

You can see the *national ranking*, grouping the view by the nationality of the competitor. The
:guilabel:`print` button takes the current view in account and thus it emits the normal or the
grouped printout.

.. hint:: By double-clicking on a competitor the matches_ panel focuses on him showing only his
          matches. You can see any other player details by double-clicking on another name. The
          match panel returns to the usual view either by double-clicking the same player a
          second time, or when a new turn is created.

Once the :guilabel:`Prize-giving` is done, the :guilabel:`prize` column becomes editable,
either to manually force the prizes, or to eventually swap top players after the final.
