Description: cottonmouth
        ===========
        
        Pure-Python HTML generation, inspired by [Hiccup][1].
        
        ```python
        from cottonmouth.html import render
        from cottonmouth.tags import html, head, body, title, meta, link, h1
        
        def welcome(user=None, **context):
            return ['p', 'Welcome' + (' back!' if user else '!')]
        
        content = (
            # Feel free to use raw HTML
            '<!doctype html>',
            # Tags are represented as sequences with a tag name at the head
            [html,
                # Or just use strings instead of the default tag symbols
                ['head',
                    [title, 'The Site'],
                    # Attributes are passed as a dict immediately after the tag
                    [meta, {'charset': 'utf-8'}],
                    [link, dict(rel='stylesheet', type='text/css',
                                href='static/layout.css')]],
                [body,
                    # You can also call tags as functions with the content as
                    # the first argument and attributes as `kwargs`
                    [header, h1(u'The Website', id='header')],
                    # Use "#id.class" shortcuts to easily create `div` elements
                    ['#map.pretty-map'],
                    # Functions will be called with context and the results rendered
                    ['#main', welcome]]]
        )
        
        render(*content, user=None)
        ```
        
        Equivalent output:
        
        ```html
        <!doctype html>
        <html>
        <head>
          <title>The Site</title>
          <meta content="text/html;charset=utf-8" http-equiv="content-type">
          <link href="static/layout.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
        </head>
        <body>
          <h1 id="header">Welcome to the site!</h1>
          <div id="map" class="pretty-map"></div>
          <div id="main">
            <p>Welcome!</p>
          </div>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
