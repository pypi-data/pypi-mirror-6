        ==================================
        
        This application allows you to manage your sales goals in an effective and efficient manner by keeping track of all sales orders and history.
        
        It handles the full sales workflow:
        
        * **Quotation** -> **Sales order** -> **Invoice**

        If you also installed the Warehouse Management, you can deal with the following preferences:
        
        * Shipping: Choice of delivery at once or partial delivery
        * Invoicing: choose how invoices will be paid
        * Incoterms: International Commercial terms
        
        You can choose flexible invoicing methods:
        
        * *On Demand*: Invoices are created manually from Sales Orders when needed
        * *On Delivery Order*: Invoices are generated from picking (delivery)
        * *Before Delivery*: A Draft invoice is created and must be paid before delivery
