Description: Craig's Generator
        ======
        Read listings Pythonically.
        
        Examples
        ---------
        Generate listings.
        
            from craigsgenerator import Section
            for listing in Section('oakland','sub'):
                print(listing)
        
        Additional arguments get passed to ``requests.get``.
        
            from craigsgenerator import Section
            proxies = {'https':'example.com'}
            for listing in Section('oakland','sub', proxies = proxies):
                print(listing)
        
        Downloaded files are cached by default and refreshed
        if they're older than a day. Change the directory by
        specifying the ``cachedir``.
        
            from craigsgenerator import Section
            for listing in Section('oakland','sub', cachedir = 'downloads'):
                print(listing)
        
        Disable caching by setting the ``cachedir`` to ``None``.
        
            from craigsgenerator import Section
            for listing in Section('oakland','sub', cachedir = None):
                print(listing)
