        ************************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `vanderlee/colorpicker`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org/
        .. _`vanderlee/colorpicker`: https://github.com/vanderlee/colorpicker
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.vanderlee_colorpicker``) are published to some URL.
        
        The parsers and swatches are not included in the default resource
        ``colorpicker``, but have their own resources (``cmyk_parser``,
        ``cmyk_percentrage_parser``, ``swatches_crayola``, ``swatches_pantone``,
        ``swatches_ral``), so remember to ``need()`` these explicitly if you want to
        use some of those features.
        
        The translations are not included in this package (yet?).
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``colorpicker`` from ``js.vanderlee_colorpicker`` and
        ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.vanderlee_colorpicker import colorpicker
          >>> colorpicker.need()
