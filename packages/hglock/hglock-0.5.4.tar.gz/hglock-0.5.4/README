==============
lock extension
==============

While Mercurial is all about being decentralized, it is sometimes very
useful to work in a centralized fashion: if the files you work on
cannot be merged (binary files such as Word documents, Photoshop
images, etc) then it is better to communicate upfront about any edits
to avoid concurrent work.

Please see the `documentation in the wiki`__ for more information.

0.5 — 2011-10-20
""""""""""""""""

* Lock files on copy and rename. With our model, the server wont
  accept a push that involves unlocked files for which locking is
  mandatory, except for newly added files. Such files appear after a
  rename if the new file is not locked. However, the user cannot lock
  the file since it is not on the server yet.

  The extension will now internally acquire a lock for the destination
  name of a rename or copy. For rename, the lock for the original file
  is left in place so that the user own locks for both the old and the
  new name.

* Fixed Issue 3: File write permissions not updated on initial clone
  when an .hgignore file exists

    https://bitbucket.org/lantiq/hglock/issue/3/

* Tested the extension with Mercurial versions 1.8.4 to 2.0 and
  rewrote code and tests to maintain compatibility.

0.4 — 2011-08-18
""""""""""""""""

* Experimental support for marking unlocked files as read-only. This
  is similar to how SVN works when a file has the ``svn:needs-lock``
  property set.

  This is not yet advertised in the extension help and is turned off
  by default. To enable, add the following to a configuration file::

    [hglock]
    updatewriteperm = True

  When a repository is cloned, files marked as needing locking
  (matched by ``.hglocks``) will be checked out read-only. When a file
  is locked, it will be made writable. When a file is unlocked (with
  via ``hg unlock FILE`` or ``hg push``), it will be read-only again.

  Thanks to Scott Sturdivant for contributing this feature.

* The update and commit commands use locks implicitly and will now
  silently ignore a missing or uninitialized lock repository. Before,
  ``hg update`` would abort if the lock repository was not
  initialized, it now outputs a warnings that is only shown when
  ``--verbose`` is used.

* Refactored code for better maintainability. The remote procedure
  call protocol now lives in its own module.

0.3 — 2011-08-09
""""""""""""""""

* Client-side checking of pushed changesets. Before pushing, clients
  now inspects each outgoing changeset to see if it contains
  modifications to an unlocked file for which locking is mandatory.
  The push is aborted if such a changeset is found.

* Make ``hg unlock`` validate the client's changeset the same way ``hg
  lock`` does. This ensures that a client does not unlock a file
  before the changesets that modify it have been pushed.

  The primary way to unlock files is now to simply push the changesets
  that affect the files -- the unlock command can only be used if a
  file has not been modified since it was locked.

* Disabled ``--force`` flag for ``hg push``. Creating multiple heads
  on push is then no longer possible. Pushing a new branch is still
  possible with the ``--new-branch`` flag.

* Fix compatibility with Mercurial 1.9.x. Now tested with Mercurial
  version 1.8.4, 1.9, and 1.9.1.

0.2 — 2011-07-22
""""""""""""""""

* Re-release of version 0.1.

  The change from a changegroup hook to a pretxnchangegroup hook in
  575c95b4ab8f had bad consequences. So 575c95b4ab8f and the followup
  fixes (d87f0dc0919e, 4ba9b24da91b, 7ec8374652ad) were too unstable
  to release.

  This release builds on 4b61dc057391 and includes only the fix for
  lock identifying the wrong file in a merge (7e3a4247e682 and
  019d137a6ece) along with the packaging changes.

0.1 — 2011-07-20
""""""""""""""""

* First tagged release.
