=====

edbob is a Pythonic software framework, released under the GNU Affero General
Public License.

It aims to be "environment-neutral" in that it can assist with development for
console, web, or GUI applications.  Pay only for what you eat; however all of
its functionality combined may be considered a "full stack" of sorts.
