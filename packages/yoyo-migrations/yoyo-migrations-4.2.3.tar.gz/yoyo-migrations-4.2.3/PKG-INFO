Description: Yoyo database migrations
        ========================
        
        Yoyo is a database schema migration tool using plain SQL and python's builtin 
        DB-API.
        
        What does yoyo-migrations do?
        -----------------------------
        
        As database applications evolve, changes to the database schema are often
        required. These can usually be written as one-off SQL scripts containing
        CREATE/ALTER table statements (although any SQL or python script may be used
        with yoyo).
        
        Yoyo provides a command line tool for reading a directory of such
        scripts and applying them to your database as required.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install from the PyPI with the command::
        
          pip install yoyo-migrations
        
        Database support
        ----------------
        
        PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite databases are supported.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Yoyo is usually invoked as a command line script.
        
        Examples:
        
        Read all migrations from directory ``migrations`` and apply them to a
        PostgreSQL database::
        
           yoyo-migrate apply ./migrations/ postgres://user:password@localhost/database
        
        Rollback migrations previously applied to a MySQL database::
        
           yoyo-migrate rollback ./migrations/ mysql://user:password@localhost/database
        
        Reapply (ie rollback then apply again) migrations to a SQLite database at
        location ``/home/sheila/important-data.db``::
        
            yoyo-migrate reapply ./migrations/ sqlite:////home/sheila/important-data.db
        
        By default, yoyo-migrations starts in an interactive mode, prompting you for
        each migration file before applying it, making it easy to choose which
        migrations to apply and rollback.
        
        The migrations directory should contain a series of migration scripts. Each
        migration script is a python file (``.py``) containing a series of steps. Each
        step should comprise a migration query and (optionally) a rollback query. For
        example::
        
            #
            # file: migrations/0001.create-foo.py
            #
            from yoyo import step
            step(
                "CREATE TABLE foo (id INT, bar VARCHAR(20), PRIMARY KEY (id))",
                "DROP TABLE foo",
            )
        
        The filename of each file (without the .py extension) is used as the identifier
        for each migration. Migrations are applied in filename order, so it's useful to
        name your files using a date (eg '20090115-xyz.py') or some other incrementing
        number.
        
        yoyo-migrate creates a table in your target database, ``_yoyo_migration``, to
        track which migrations have been applied.
        
        Steps may also take an optional argument ``ignore_errors``, which must be one
        of ``apply``, ``rollback``, or ``all``. If in the previous example the table
        foo might have already been created by another means, we could add
        ``ignore_errors='apply'`` to the step to allow the migrations to continue
        regardless::
        
            #
            # file: migrations/0001.create-foo.py
            #
            from yoyo import step
            step(
                "CREATE TABLE foo (id INT, bar VARCHAR(20), PRIMARY KEY (id))",
                "DROP TABLE foo",
                ignore_errors='apply',
            )
        
        Steps can also be python callable objects that take a database connection as
        their single argument. For example::
        
            #
            # file: migrations/0002.update-keys.py
            #
            from yoyo import step
            def do_step(conn):
                cursor = conn.cursor()
                cursor.execute(
                    "INSERT INTO sysinfo "
                    " (osname, hostname, release, version, arch)"
                    " VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s %s)",
                    os.uname()
                ) 
        
            step(do_step)
        
        Transactions
        ------------
        
        By default each step is run in its own transaction.
        You can run multiple steps within a single transaction by wrapping them in a
        ``transaction`` call, like so::
        
          #
          # file: migrations/0001.create-foo.py
          #
          from yoyo import step, transaction
          transaction(
            step(
              "CREATE TABLE foo (id INT, bar VARCHAR(20), PRIMARY KEY (id))",
              "DROP TABLE foo",
            ),
            step("INSERT INTO foo (1, 'baz')"),
            ignore_errors='all',
          )
        
        If this is the case setting ``ignore_errors`` on individual steps makes no
        sense: database errors will always cause the entire transaction to be rolled
        back. The outer ``transaction`` can however have ``ignore_errors`` set.
        
        Post-apply hook
        ---------------
        
        It can be useful to have a script that's run after successful migrations. For
        example you could use this to update database permissions or re-create views.
        To do this, create a migration file called ``post-apply.py``. This file should
        have the same format as any other migration file.
        
        Password security
        -----------------
        
        You normally specify your database username and password as part of the
        database connection string on the command line. On a multi-user machine, other
        users could view your database password in the process list.
        
        The ``-p`` or ``--prompt-password`` flag causes yoyo-migrate to prompt
        for a password, ignoring any password specified in the connection string. This
        password will not be available to other users via the system's process list.
        
        Connection string caching
        -------------------------
        
        The first time you run ``yoyo-migrate`` on a new set of migrations, you will be
        asked if you want to cache the database connection string in a file
        called ``.yoyo-migrate`` in the migrations directory.  
        
        This cache is local to the migrations directory, so subsequent runs
        on the same migration set do not need the database connection string to be
        specified.
        
        This saves typing, avoids your database username and password showing in
        process listings and lessens the risk of accidentally running ``yoyo-migrate``
        on the wrong database (ie by re-running an earlier ``yoyo-migrate`` entry in
        your command history when you have moved to a different directory).
        
        If you do not want this cache file to be used, add the ``--no-cache`` parameter
        to the command line options.
        
        Using yoyo from python code
        ---------------------------
        
        The following example shows how to apply migrations from inside python code::
        
            from yoyo import read_migrations
            from yoyo.connections import connect
        
            conn, paramstyle = connect('postgres://myuser@localhost/mydatabase')
            migrations = read_migrations(conn, paramstyle, 'path/to/migrations'))
            migrations.to_apply().apply()
            conn.commit()
        
        .. :vim:sw=4:et
        
        
        CHANGELOG
        ---------
        
        Version 4.2.3
        
        * Migrations are now datestamped with a UTC date
        
        * Fixes for installation and use under python 3
        
        Version 4.2.2
        
        * Migration scripts can start with ``from yoyo import step, transaction``.
          This prevents linters (eg flake8) throwing errors over undefined names.
        
        * Bugfix: functions declared in a migration file can access the script's global
          namespace
        
        Version 4.2.1
        
        * Bugfix for previous release, which omitted critical files
        
        Version 4.2.0
        
        * Removed yoyo.migrate namespace package. Any code that uses the yoyo api
          directly needs have any imports modified, eg this::
        
            from yoyo.migrate import read_migrations
            from yoyo.migrate.connections import connect
        
          Should be changed to this::
        
            from yoyo import read_migrations
            from yoyo.connections import connect
        
        * Migrated from darcs to mercurial. Code is now hosted at
          https://bitbucket.org/ollyc/yoyo
        
        * Bugfix: the migration_table option was not being passed to read_migrations,
          causing the value to be ignored
        
        Version 4.1.6
        
        * Added windows support (thanks to Peter Shinners)
        
        Version 4.1.5
        
        * Configure logging handlers so that the -v switch causes output to go to the
          console (thanks to Andrew Nelis).
        
        * ``-v`` command line switch no longer takes an argument but may be specified
          multiple times instead (ie use ``-vvv`` instead of ``-v3``). ``--verbosity``
          retains the old behaviour.
        
        Version 4.1.4
        
        * Bugfix for post apply hooks
        
        Version 4.1.3
        
        * Changed default migration table name back to '_yoyo_migration'
        
        Version 4.1.2
        
        * Bugfix for error when running in interactive mode
        
        Version 4.1.1
        
        * Introduced configuration option for migration table name
        
        Version 4.1.0
        
        * Introduced ability to run steps within a transaction (thanks to Ryan Williams
          for suggesting this functionality along with assorted bug fixes.)
        
        * "post-apply" migrations can be run after every successful upward migration
        
        * Other minor bugfixes and improvements
        
        * Switched to <major>.<minor> version numbering convention
        
        Version 4
        
        * Fixed problem installing due to missing manifest entry
        
        Version 3
        
        * Use the console_scripts entry_point in preference to scripts=[] in
        setup.py, this provides better interoperability with buildout
        
        Version 2
        
        * Fixed error when reading dburi from config file
        
        Version 1
        
        * Initial release
