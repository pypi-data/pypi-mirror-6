Description: Tools for creating Valve Map Format (VMF) files
        -----------------------------------------------
        
        vmflib is a python module to help developers create maps for VMF-compatible 
        video games procedurally using Python. The VMF format is best known for its 
        use in the Source Engine and its many games.
        
        Also included is a script (buildbsp) to help automate the process of compiling
        and installing VMF maps into ready-to-use BSP files.
        
        This package requires Python 3 or later.
