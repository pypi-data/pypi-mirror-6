**Hieroglyph** is an extension for `Sphinx`_ which builds HTML5 slides
from ReStructured Text documents.

Installing
==========

You can install **Hieroglyph** using ``easy_install`` or ``pip``::

   $ easy_install hieroglyph

You can also download the `latest development version`_, which may
contain new features. Hieroglyph supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.3.

Using Hieroglyph
================

You can start a new **Hieroglyph** presentation using the included
quickstart script::

  $ hieroglyph-quickstart

This will generate the Sphinx configuration, along with an optional
Makefile and batch file, with Hieroglyph enabled.

If you're on something UNIX-like (Linux, Mac OS X, etc), you can then
generate your slides by running ``make``::

  $ make slides


You can also add **Hieroglyph** as a Sphinx extension to your
existing configuration::

  extensions = [
      'hieroglyph',
  ]
