Description: ====
        x/84
        ====
        
        **A python Telnet server for modern UTF-8 and classic cp437 network virtual terminals**.
        
        x/84 supplies a scripting_ engine for developing character-at a time telnet services, such as **MUD** or **BBS** systems.  Technologies used in x/84 are derived from miniboa_ (Apache 2.0 Licensed) for telnet, blessings_ (MIT Licensed) for terminal capabilities, and sqlitedict_ (Public Domain) for persistent data. Recordings of sessions are stored in ttyplay_-compatible format files.
        
        Asynchronous inter-process communication between sessions is provided through an event queuing framework, for scripting of 'shared' experiences. Several examples of these are provided, such as *chat.py*. The default board provides several activities.
        
        Portability is as equal to python, and has been tested on Raspberry Pi, Android, Mac, OpenBSD, Solaris, etc.
        
        **ANSI Art**, such as found on ACiD_ *dark domains* DVD, is translated for reasonably accurate reproductions for both UTF-8 and IBM CP437 terminals. This allows classic DOS art to be used on modern terminals such as Terminal.app, or classic emulating terminals such as syncterm_. Artwork with Sauce_ records are also supported.
        
        Telnet to host address 1984.ws to preview the default board. See clients_ for a list of compatible clients.
        
        
        Install
        =======
        
        1. Install python_ 2.6 or 2.7
        
        2. Install pip_
        
        3. Ensure pip is up-to-date::
        
             pip install --upgrade pip
        
        4. Install x/84::
        
             pip install x84
        
        5. Upgrading::
        
             pip install --upgrade x84
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        1. Launch the *x84.engine* python module::
        
             x84
        
           If the ``*x84`` helper script fails, try using the
           python interpreter used by ``pip``::
        
             python2.7 -m x84.engine
        
        
        2. Telnet to 127.0.0.1 6023, Assuming a *bsd telnet* client::
        
             telnet localhost 6023
