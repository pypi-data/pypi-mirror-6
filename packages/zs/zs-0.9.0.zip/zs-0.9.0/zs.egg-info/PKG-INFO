Description: ZS is a simple, read-only, binary file format designed for
        distributing, querying, and archiving arbitrarily large
        record-oriented datasets (up to tens of terabytes and beyond). It
        allows the data to be stored in compressed form, while still
        supporting very fast queries for either specific entries, or for all
        entries in a specified range of values (e.g., prefix searches), and
        allows highly-CPU-parallel decompression. It also places an emphasis
        on data integrity -- all data is protected by 64-bit CRC checksums --
        and on discoverability -- every ZS file includes arbitrarily detailed
        structured metadata stored directly inside it.
        
        Basically you can think of ZS as a turbo-charged replacement for
        storing data in line-based text file formats. It was originally
        developed to provide a better way to work with the massive `Google N-grams
        <http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html>`_,
        but is potentially useful for data sets of any size.
