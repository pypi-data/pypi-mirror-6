Description: Interlude - Interactive Doctests
        ================================
        
        Provides an interactive shell aka console inside your doctest case.
        
        The console looks exact like in a doctest-case and you can copy and paste
        code from the shell into your doctest. It feels as you are in the test case
        itself. Its not pdb, it's a python shell.
        
        In your doctest you can invoke the shell at any point by calling::
        
            >>> interact(locals())
        
        
        To make your testrunner interlude aware, pass ``interact`` as a global to the
        ``DocFileSuite`` as shown here::
        
            ...
            import interlude
            ...
            suite = DocFileSuite( ..., globs=dict(interact=interlude.interact), ...)
            ...
        
        
        If `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ is available it opens an IPython prompt.
        The prompt is modified and looks like in a doctest. To surpress the
        prompt modifications call ``interact`` with additional kwarg
        ``doctest_prompt=False``.

        =======
        
        1.3.1
        -----
        
        - refactoring introduced bug: classic prompt ``use_ipython=False`` fails if
          IPython available
          [jensens, 2014-02-09]
        
        1.3
        ---
        
        - needs IPython 1.1.0 or better. Skipped support for older versions.
          [jensens, 2014-02-09]
        
        - added extra require, so when ipython is wanted just depend in buildout,
          pip-requirements, setup, (name it) on``interlude[ipython]``
          [jensens, 2014-02-09]
        
        - start IPython shell with a custom doctest prompt, thus it is easier to
          copy-paste from the shell to the doctest (save a typing a ``%doctest_mode``
          each time. Added also option ``doctest_prompt=False`` to disable this.
