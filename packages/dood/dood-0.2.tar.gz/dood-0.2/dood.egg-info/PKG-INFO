Description: Dood
        ====
        
        Simplified access to the Doodle API. Can be found on PyPI. Crappy hack, not
        recommended for use.
        
        Note: XML isn't fun, neither is the Doodle API nor is finding it, so take this
        library as it is, without expectations of huge improvements. Pull requests or
        feedback, however, welcome.
