Description: BasicX is a programming language for a series of microcontrollers designed and
        built by NetMedia, Inc. These microcontrollers, the BX01, the BX24, and BX35, 
        are little more than a modified AVR with a bootloader. However, the presence of
        the bootloader means that we can only program them using the BasicX language.
        
        This language is feature-complete with VB 6, and can only be compiled by an IDE 
        nearly ten-years old.
        
        These tools are written to change that.
        
        There are three scripts, bxbuild, bxdebug, and bxproj, and a suite of shared
        libraries they all depend upon. bxproj will create new BasicX projects, bxbuild
        will compile them and download them to target devices, and bxdebug will read
        debugging messages being transmitted over RS232 serial communication.
        
        For more information about BasicX, see http://www.basicx.com/
        
        Note that to use these tools, you'll need the BasicX compiler installed. This
        can be found here (http://www.basicx.com/downloads/bx-setup-210-complete.zip)
        for Windows. Unix users will need to use Wine to make this work.
