===============

Orange Textable is an add-on for Orange_ data mining software package. It
enables users to build data tables on the basis of text data, by means of a
flexible and intuitive interface. Look at the following `example
<http://orange-textable.readthedocs.org/en/latest/illustration.html>`_ to see
it in typical action.

Orange Textable offers in particular the following features:

- import text data from various sources
- apply systematic recoding operations
- apply analytical processes such as segmentation and annotation
- extract and exploit XML-encoded annotations
- manually, automatically or randomly select unit subsets
- build concordances and collocation lists
- compute quantitative indices such as frequency and complexity measures
