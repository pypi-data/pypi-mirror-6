Description: Damm algorithm decimal check digit
        
        Note that check digits are NOT used for verification of data transfers between
        computers -- use a CRC or a hash for that purpose! Check digits are used to
        check *manual* entry of a digit into a computer system.
        
        A Damm check digit is a single decimal check digit that can detect any
        single-digit error as well as any adjacent-digit transpositions. The digit
        computed in this module also detects some important phonetic errors (13<->30,
        14<->40, ... 19<-->90).
        
        This makes the Damm check digit better than other, more well-known check digits
        like the Luhn code (used in credit cards) and the ISBN base-11 check digit. It
        is equal in detection strength to a Verhoeff check digit, but much simpler to
        compute.
        
        There are two functions in this module: `encode` and `check`. The first,
        `encode` is used to calculate the check digit for a number that you have. The
        second, `check` is used to check that a number that was entered was entered
        correctly.
        
        The Damm check digit is computed by starting with a check digit of zero and then
        continually multiplying this check digit with the digits of a given number,
        using the multiplication of a totally anti-symmetric quasigroup. The properties
        and the selection of the group ensure the qualities of the check digit stated
        above.
