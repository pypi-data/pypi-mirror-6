* DSPAM running in daemon mode

To use the milter, you also need:

* pymilter_ (python-milter)

Installation
============

To install, simply run ``python setup.py install`` in the distibution root.

Milter usage
============

The Milter is a ready to use application. The command ``dspam-milter`` should
have been installed in your path. Behaviour of the daemon can be controlled
by editing ``/etc/dspam-milter.cfg``. In general dlmtp_* settings need to be
configured, and added to dspam.conf.

The correct configuration of the DSPAM daemon is also documented in 
``dspam-milter.cfg``.
