0.4.0: February 28, 2014
    - Resource: automatically handle JSON input. If the JSON data is a
      dictionary, then it is automatically passed into the methods, just like
      URL parameters, GET data and POST data.


0.3.1: November 21, 2012
    - Fix: Log all exceptions. There were some code paths where an exception
      wouldn't be logged at all.
    - Fix: Some typos in the log output have been corrected.
    - Fix: Fix output of the `/_internal/help` resource.


0.3.0: January 17, 2012
    - Upgrade WebOb requirement and support WebOb 1.1
    - Resource: The `DECODE_PARAMS` option has been removed.


0.2.7: July 28, 2011
    - Resource: remove illegal XML characters from XML output.


0.2.6: July 5, 2011
    - Resource: The `expires` decorator accepts a new parameter `vary`. It can
      be set to a list of header names that should be included in the `Vary`
      response header.


0.2.5: November 3, 2010
    - Resource: New option `DECODE_PARAMS` that can be used to turn off
      URL-decoding of parameters.


0.2.4: May 18, 2010
    - Resource: Make validation more robust for the case when value is a
      unicode string.
    - Resource: The decorator `validate` accepts a callable `convert` used to
      convert the input string values to the data format required by the
      service.
    - Status: Convert the Location argument for `raise_201` and others to a
      string.
    - Status: Correctly handle generation of the Location header when the
      current request contains an extension such as .json or .xml.
    - License has been clarified and is BSD.


0.2.3: January 5, 2010
    - Remove Content-Type header when there is no content in the response.
    - xmlserializer: Move XML serialisation into a separate module.
    - Output an error message in the body of 404 responses.
    - Allow specifying of the encoding to be sent with the Content Type
      reponse header.
    - Make compatible with WebOb 0.9.7


0.2.2: July 29, 2009
    - Resource: Fix XML output for unicode strings.


0.2.1: July 15, 2009
    - Routing: Use extensions defined by resource in EXTENSION_MAP dictionary
      instead of the hardcoded list of '.xml' and '.json'.
    - Resource: Change EXTENSION_MAP to a list instead of a dictionary, so we
      can rely on the order of entries. Breaks backwards-compatibility for
      resources with a custom EXTENSION_MAP.
    - Resource: Remove hard-coded setting of Content-Type and Content-MD5
      response headers. Move into a new generic method set_response_headers
      which in turn calls the two methods set_response_content_type and
      set_response_content_md5. This allows for easier overwriting in
      subclasses.
    - Resource: Output valid XML when serializing lists. Each child is now
      <child order="N"> instead of just <N> (where N is the array index).
    - Help resource: Sort the resources by name, mark parameters with
      validation rules as mandatory.
    - Documentation: Add a lot of additional documentation. Document the
      current state of HTTP implementation.


0.2: June 29, 2009
    - Initial packaged release of WsgiService.
