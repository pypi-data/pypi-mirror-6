Description: Freeseer is a tool for capturing or streaming video.
        
        It enables you to capture great presentations, demos, training material,
        and other videos. It handles desktop screen-casting with ease.
        
        Freeseer is one of a few such tools that can also record vga output 
        or video from external sources such as firewire, usb, s-video, or rca.
        
        It is particularly good at handling very large conferences with hundreds 
        of talks and speakers using varied hardware and operating systems.
        
        Freeseer itself can run on commodity hardware such as a laptop or desktop.
