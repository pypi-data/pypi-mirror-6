Photini
=======

An easy to use digital photograph metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP) editing application.

"It doesn't try to be an all-singing, all-dancing image management powerhouse &mdash; it just lets you add information to photos, quickly and easily." &mdash; [Linux Format](http://www.linuxformat.com/) magazine, January 2013

Warning
-------

This program is currently at an early stage of development, but it is already usable. However, like all other software, it has bugs. Before using it be sure to back up all your photographs (you do this anyway, right?) as I can't guarantee you won't accidentally damage them.
