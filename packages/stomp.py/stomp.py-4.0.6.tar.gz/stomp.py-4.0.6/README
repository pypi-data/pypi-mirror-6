README
======

"stomp.py" is a Python client library for accessing messaging servers
(such as ActiveMQ, Apollo or RabbitMQ) using the `STOMP protocol`_
(versions `1.0`_, `1.1`_ and `1.2`_). It can also be run as a
standalone, command-line client for testing.

Quick Start
-----------

A basic example of using stomp.py can be found `here`_. Testing via the
command-line interface is described
`here <https://github.com/kwoli/stomp.py/wiki/Command-Line-Access>`__.

| Downloads can be found on `PyPi`_.
| API documentation can be found
`here <http://jasonrbriggs.github.io/stomp.py/index.html>`__.

Please note that stomp.py was available as a single file (stomp.py), but
as of version 2 was split into multiple files in a module directory
(click `this link`_ if you still want access to this older version).

Select:

-  `Version 4.0+`_ for both Python2.x and Python3.x - with support for
   STOMP 1.2 (note this version separates the transport mechanism from
   the protocol)
-  `Version 3.0+`_ for both Python2.x and Python3.x - STOMP 1.0 and 1.1
   only
-  `Version 2.0.x`_ for Python2.x

stomp.py has been perfunctorily tested on: `ActiveMQ`_, `Apollo`_,
`RabbitMQ`_, `stompserver`_, and has been reported to work with
`JBossMessaging`_. For more info on setting up the test server (using
virtualbox), contact the developer.
