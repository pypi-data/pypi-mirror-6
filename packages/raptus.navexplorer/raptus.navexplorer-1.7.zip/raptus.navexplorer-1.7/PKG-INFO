Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This plone product has been developed to support customers and webmasters in keeping an overview of their plone site and helping them control and manipulate it. The complete content of the plone site is represented as a structured tree. This tree is presented in a separated frame not to compromise the display of the plone site itself. In addition, much information is shown for each content-type.
        
        To allow easy manipulation of a content item, all the regular actions are accessible in a context menu available on the repsective node of the tree. With only a few mouse clicks one can navigate miscellaneous views.
        
        The tree supports **drag&drop**, allowing single or multiple content-types to be moved into others.
