        `kotti_accounts`_ is a `Kotti`_ plugin which allows a user principal to be associated to
        multiple email accounts.

        For the impatient
        =================
        
        There's a demo which shows how it works.
        Just run the commands below inside a clean virtualenv.
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/frgomes/kotti_velruse_demo.git
            cd kotti_velruse_demo
            ./run-server.sh
        
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        1. Insert ``kotti_accounts.kotti_configure`` on ``kotti.configurators``
        
        ::
        
            kotti.configurators = kotti_velruse.kotti_configure
                                  kotti_accounts.kotti_configure
                                  # other plugins...
        
        2. See also kotti_velruse_ for other configurations, since ``kotti_velruse`` and
           ``kotti_accounts`` were designed to work together.
        
        
        Design Decisions
        ================
        
        * associate multiple externally authenticated identities to a single Principal.
        
        * substitute part of the internal registration workflow provided by ``kotti.security``.
        
        * behave as a drop-in to the existing ``kotti.security`` Principals.
        
        * all existing test cases depending on Principals must pass.
        
        * integrate with `kotti_velruse`_ via events.
        
        
        Workflow
        ========
        
        New user
        --------
        
        The actions enumerated below happen when a user authenticates for the first time using
        his/her external OpenID account (or any other authentication method):
        
        - the user's real name and email address are obtained from the external provider;
        
        - a new Principal is created and populated with the real name and email address;
        
        - a new Account is created and populated with the email address;
        
        - the newly created Account is associated with the newly created Principal;
        
        - event UserSelfRegistered is triggered, in order to integrate with other plugins.
        
        - the session is then authenticated with the allocated Principal.
        
        
        Returning user
        --------------
        
        These actions enumerated below happen when a returning user authenticates:
        
        - the user's real name and email address are obtained from the external provider;
        
        - find the Account which matches the email address;
        
        - finds the Principal associated with the Account;
        
        - the session is then authenticated with the Principal found.
        
        
        Add email to existing user
        --------------------------
        
        These actions enumerated below happen when new email addresses are added to an existing
        Principal, using the new Preferences page:
        
        - the user remains authenticated as he/she was, keeping the current Principal;
        
        - the user performs a new login, authenticates against another external provider;
        
        - the user's real name and email address are obtained from the external provider;
        
        - a new Account is created and populated with the email address; the real name is discarded;
        
        - the newly created Account is associated with the existing created Principal;
        
        - the session remains authenticated as it was in the beginning.
        
        
        Pending
        -------
        
        - (TODO) ability to merge accounts.
        
        
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        How do I authenticate as administrator?
        ---------------------------------------
        
        The default authentication method provided by Kotti retrieves Principals from the database
        and compares the password you type against what is stored there. The authentication method
        provided by ``kotti_accounts`` relies on authentication performed by external providers,
        which means that the usual ``admin/qwerty`` is not valid anymore.
        
        The way to become administrator consists on these steps:
        
        - Insert something similar to the below into your configuration file:
        
        ::
        
            kotti.accounts.admins = admin@example.com
                                    webmaster@example.com
        
        .. note::
        
            This allows the specified list of emails to be understood as special.
            It means that administrator rights will be automatically assigned **only** at Principal
            creation, which happens *when the user authenticates for the first time*.
        
        - Start the server and authenticate using some external provider, employing any of the
          emails listed as part of ``kotti.accounts.admins``.
        
        - Stop the server
        
        - Remove the configuration you just done on ``kotti.accounts.admins``.
        
        .. warning::
        
            In order to enforce security, it's a good practice to remove ``kotti.accounts.admins``
            from your configuration.
        
        
        - Start the server
        
        
        
        When you login to your previously created user account, using an external provider, you
        will be recognized as administrator.
