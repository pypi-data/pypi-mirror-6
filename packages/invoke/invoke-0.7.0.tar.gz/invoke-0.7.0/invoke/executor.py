        Initialize executor with handles to a task collection & config context.

        The collection is used for looking up tasks by name and
        storing/retrieving state, e.g. how many times a given task has been run
        this session and so on.

        A copy of the context is passed into any tasks that mark themselves as
        requiring one for operation.

            A string naming which task from the Executor's `.Collection` is to
            be executed. May contain dotted syntax appropriate for calling
            namespaced tasks, e.g. ``subcollection.taskname``.

            A keyword argument dict expanded when calling the requested task.
            E.g.::

                executor.execute('mytask', {'myarg': 'foo'})
