SilvaExternalSource - Silva Code Source

  The "Silva Code Source" is the replacement for what is known as the
  "code_sources" or "code" Document element.

  Essentially a Code Source wraps arbritrary code fragments like DTML, ZPT
  and Python Scripts, where the results of executing these code fragments
  can be rendered into a Silva Document.

  Adding:

    When adding one needs to provide the new Code Source an id, title and a
    script id. It is this script id that is used to determine what code
    fragment to execute. After adding a Code Source, it will need some more
    editing.

  Editing:

    There are three important parts of a Code Source that need editing:

    1) Basic settings:

      Title, script id, data encoding, description, cacheable setting...

    2) Parameters:

      Formulator form...

    3) Contents:

      Actual scripts are here...
