Description: MangoEngine
        ===========
        
        MangoEngine is a lightweight library for creating generic data models in Python.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            class City(Model):
                name = StringField()
                officials = DictField(
                    of_key = StringField(),
                    of_value = StringField()
                )
                population = IntegerField(bounds = (0, None))
        
        The models you create with MangoEngine are self-documenting and simple to create. Even better, you can populate them from unreliable sources and validate them to ensure your data is sane.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> city = City.from_dict({
            ...     "name": 12,
            ...     "officials": {1: 2},
            ...     "population": "alot"
            ... })
            >>> city.validate()
            ValidationError: For field 'name': expecting instance of basestring, got int.
        
        You can leverage this library to create your own light-weight ORM for your application regardless of what your backing store is, without abstracting away important details like queries.

        About the Project
        -----------------
        
        This library started as a means to create models for JSON objects, but has since evolved into a more general purpose library. Its interface is inspired by the fantastic `MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_ library (thus its name). It was created by `John Sullivan <http://johnsullivan.name>`_ and he would greatly appreciate any contributions.
