Description: Titlecase
        =========
        
        This filter changes all words to Title Caps, and attempts to be clever
        about *un*\ SMALL words like a/an/the in the input.
        
        The list of "SMALL words" which are not capped comes from the New York
        Times Manual of Style, plus 'vs' and 'v'.
        
        This is a fork of `Stuart Colville's
        titlecase.py <https://muffinresearch.co.uk/titlecasepy-titlecase-in-python/>`__,
        which was in turn a port of `John Gruber's
        titlecase.pl <http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case>`__.
        
        The purpose of this fork is to update the package to support Python 3 as
        well as provide a maintained version of this utility. Issues or better
        pull requests are welcome.
