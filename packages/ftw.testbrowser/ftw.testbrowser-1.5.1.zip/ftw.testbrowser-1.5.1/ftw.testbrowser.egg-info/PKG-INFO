        `ftw.testbrowser` is a browser library for testing `Plone`_ web sites and
        applications.
        It integrations directly into `Plone` / `Zope` and uses `lxml`_ for parsing
        and querying pages. It supports all the basic features such as filling forms.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        1.5.1 (2014-01-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix encoding problems when posting unicode data directly with Browser.open.
          [jone]
        
        - Support form filling with bytestrings.
          [jone]
        
        - Fix form filling with umlauts.
          [jone]
        
        - Fix form fill for single select fields.
          [jone]
        
        
        1.5.0 (2014-01-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Implement AT file upload widget, because the label does not work.
          [jone]
        
        - Implement file uploads.
          [jone]
        
        - Add "headers" property on the browser.
          [jone]
        
        
        1.4.0 (2013-12-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Deprecate `normalized_text` method, replace it with `text` property.
          The `text` property is more intuitive and easier to remember.
          The `text` property has almost the same result as `normalized_text`,
          but it represents `<br/>` and `<p>` with single and double newlines respectively.
          `text` is to be the lxml `text` property, which contained the raw, non-recursive
          text of the current node and is now available as `raw_text` property.
          [jone]
