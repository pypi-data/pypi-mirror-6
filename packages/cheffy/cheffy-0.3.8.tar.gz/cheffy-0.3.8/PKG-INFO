        ======
        
        Cheffy provides a method-based access to Chef server api. Typical usage often looks like this::
        
            # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
            from cheffy.client import Client
            from cheffy.rsa import Key
        
            chef_host = '123.123.123.123'
            chef_user = 'john'
        
            with open("private.pem", "r") as f:
                key = Key(f.read())
        
            chef_client = Client(key, chef_host, chef_user)
        
            # get clients list
            # chef_request its a dict with the request data to the chef
            # Its handy for logging.
            chef_request, chef_response = chef_client.get('/clients')
        
            clients = json.loads(chef_response.text)
