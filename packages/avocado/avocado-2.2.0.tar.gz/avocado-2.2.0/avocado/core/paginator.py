class BufferedPaginator(Paginator):
    """A subclass of the Django Paginator class that allows for explicitly
    setting the `_count` attribute i.e. the theoretical size of
    `object_list`. This removes the need for the Paginator to do determine
    the size of the `object_list` which improves performance especially for
    complex queries (and removes the need to actually pass in the
    `objec_list`).

    The `object_list` that is passed in as an argument should represent the
    *buffered* part of the whole `object_list`. This works in conjunction
    with the `BufferedPage` which can test whether or not a particular page
    is actually stored in the `BufferedPaginator` object.

    If `object_list` is not passed in, all calculations will still be
    available, but any operations that act on the `object_list` will
    throw an error, unless an `object_list` is passed in.

    The use of the class is primarily for large data sets in which it is
    impractical to store the entire `object_list` into a paginator.
    Overriding `_count` allows for the methods to still be used.

    `buf_size` represents the size of the buffer, i.e. number of rows that will
    be available at any given time and in most cases the size of `object_list`
    assuming `_count` is greater than `buf_size`..
