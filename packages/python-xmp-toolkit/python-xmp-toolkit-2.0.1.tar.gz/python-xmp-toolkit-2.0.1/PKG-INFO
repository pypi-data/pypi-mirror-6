        Python XMP Toolkit is a library for working with XMP metadata, as well as
        reading/writing XMP metadata stored in many different file formats.
        
        Python XMP Toolkit is wrapping Exempi (using ctypes), a C/C++ XMP library
        based on Adobe XMP Toolkit, ensuring that future updates to the XMP standard
        are easily incorporated into the library with a minimum amount of work.
        
        Python XMP Toolkit has been developed by:
         * ESA/Hubble - European Space Agency
         * ESO - European Southern Observatory
         * CRS4 - Centre for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia
