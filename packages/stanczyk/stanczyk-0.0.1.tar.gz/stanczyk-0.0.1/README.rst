Name and spelling
=================

``stanczyk`` is named after `Stańczyk`_, a historical Polish jester.
Other Crypto 101 projects (such as merlyn_, arthur_ and clarent_) were
already named after things from the court of Arthurian legend; I
picked Stańczyk because:

1. Poland is awesome.
2. This project looks simple, but it's actually pretty clever; perhaps
   more than its peers.
3. Poland is awesome.

The banner is an excerpt from the famous painting of Stańczyk by `Jan
Matejko`_.
