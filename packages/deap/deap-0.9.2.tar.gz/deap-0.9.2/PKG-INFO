Description: DEAP stands for Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm in Python, it is dedicated to people who
        wish to learn how to use evolutionary algorithms and to those who wish to
        rediscover evolutionary algorithms. DEAP is the proof that evolutionary 
        algorithms do **not** need to be neither complex or complicated.
        
        EAP is part of the DEAP project, that also includes some facilities for the 
        automatic distribution and parallelization of tasks over a cluster of computers.
        The D part of DEAP, called DTM, is under intense development and currently 
        available as an alpha version. DTM currently provides two and a half ways to 
        distribute work loads around a clusters or LAN of workstations, based MPI and 
        TCP communication managers.
