Description: ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Python >= 2.7
        - psutil for Python
        - Monit
        - Munin-node
        - Nginx
        
        
        ~~~~~~~~~
        Configure
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        Go in ./etc and create custom.py file. All variable in custom.py will override 
        env.py value. Modify the path in according of your host setup.
        
        To use runner_aggr, you have to configure nginx log in this way:
        - add the following new log define
        
            log_format combined2 '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]  '
                            '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                            '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" [[$request_time]]';
        
        - change every access_log directive in virtualhost, adding combined2 at the end
          
            access_log /some/where/<somename>.log combined2;
        
            
        ~~~~~~~
        Install 
        ~~~~~~~
        
        The fast way to install, is using generate.py. The help can show you the options
        
        # generate.py -h 
        
        USAGE:
                generate.py [opts]
        
          Options:
                -h, --help:     show this help
                -f:             force creation of all symlinks without asking
                -n:             force creation of new symlinks without asking
        
        If you call generate.py without arguments, you will have to answers to a question
        for every symlink. 
                
        Restart munin-node, munin-async (if you use that) and enjoy.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Known Problems
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1 - Keep attection if you use SELinux or other kind of Security access framework,
        because you have to configure all rights correctly. Usually, my choice is to
        put down, because the call of monit get error about access denied.
