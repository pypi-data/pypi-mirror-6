        Installation
        ============
        
        Install the ``plonesocial.theme`` product using the Add-on Control Panel.
        This will activate the theme and also setup Plone's default ``public.css``
        to only included when Diazo is enabled or when you are viewing the Theming 
        Control Panel. This theme includes its own ``public.css`` which had several 
        items from the default ``public.css`` removed.
        
        Features
        =========
        
        * Turn your site into a pretty Bootstrap based theme, and also simplifies
          templating of customization addons.
        * Portlets are converted to ``div`` elements instead of ``dl``, ``dt``, ``dd``
        * ``presentation_view`` is enhanced with Google's HTML5 slides
        * Included carousel portlet provides a way to display images using Bootstrap's
          carousel
        * ``eea.facetednavigation`` is also supported, with some enhancements.
        
          * The diazo rules rewrite facetednavigation templates to take advantage of
            the responsive design.
          * If the first widget at the top widget slot is a text search widget, it will 
            appear as a full width widget with a different background.
        
        * Installing ``webcouturier.dropdownmenu`` will enhance the top navigation with
          dropdown menus.
        
        Using Bootstrap javascripts
        ===========================
        
        This product leaves plone jquery alone not to break existing functionality.
        But bootstrap requires a newer jQuery version. We include the needed one renaming it to jQuery17.
        If you need js functionality from bootstrap you have to use jQuery17, for instance
        
            $(function() {
                jQuery17('.tooltipped').tooltip()
            });
        
        to activate the tooltip plugin on elements with the class "tooltipped".
