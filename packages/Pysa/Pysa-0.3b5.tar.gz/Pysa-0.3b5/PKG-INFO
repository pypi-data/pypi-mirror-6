Description: Welcome to Pysa project page
        ----------------------------
        
        Pysa is a configuration reverse engineering software, which is aimed to
        help anyone who wants to replicate an existing computer configuration -
        and not simply clone the entire machine. It can be used to migrate
        configurations from one computer to another (including physical machines
        to virtual Clouds), backup existing configurations, or for any other
        migration purpose.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Pysa has been designed for UNIX Operating Systems. However, only Linux
        based distributions are supported for now (tested on Ubuntu, Debian,
        Cent OS, RedHat and Amazon Linux latest and LTS versions). More will
        come later.
        
        There are two ways to install Pysa: using the sources files or using the
        PyPI packages repository.
        
        Using PyPI (recommended)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

           PyPI managers, like easy\_install)
        -  Setup Pysa in its latest version pip install pysa
        -  Run Pysa (see documentation)
        
        Sources setup
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
