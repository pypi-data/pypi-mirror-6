Bcfg2 - A Configuration Management System
-----------------------------------------

Bcfg2 (bee-config two) helps system administrators produce a
consistent, reproducible, and verifiable description of their
environment, and offers visualization and reporting tools to aid
in day-to-day administrative tasks. It is the fifth generation of
configuration management tools developed in the Mathematics and
Computer Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory.
