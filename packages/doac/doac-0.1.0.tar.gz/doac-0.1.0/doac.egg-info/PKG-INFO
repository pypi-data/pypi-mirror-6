Description: Django OAuth2 Consumer (doac) |Build Status|
        ============================================
        
        django-oauth2-consumer (DOAC) is a reusable application that can be used
        to provide an OAuth2 cosumer for your project. It is based on `RFC
        6749 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749>`__ for the `OAuth2
        authorization framework <http://oauth.net/2/>`__.
        
        This project is in active development in the alpha stage. It is not
        recommended for use in production and is not complete.
        
        What do I need to use this?
        ---------------------------
        
        -  Django 1.3+
        -  Django `authentication
           application <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/auth/>`__
        -  Python 2.6+
        
        This plugin has not been tested on other configurations. If it works
        with different requirements, or if a requirement is missing from the
        list, feel free to bring up an issue.
        
        What else does this have support for?
        -------------------------------------
        
        -  Django `admin
           application <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/admin/>`__
        
        Where is the documentation?
        ---------------------------
        
        The documentation is not complete, but we try our best to keep them
        current and comprehensive.
        
        `You can view them here on
        ReadTheDocs. <https://django-oauth2-consumer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__
        
        Where are the tests?
        --------------------
        
        We are trying our best to keep them up to date. Feel free to submit a
        pull request with tests for code that is missing it.
        
        | You can run the tests with:
        | ``python runtests.py``
        | The test runner has support for coverage.py along with some other
        options.
