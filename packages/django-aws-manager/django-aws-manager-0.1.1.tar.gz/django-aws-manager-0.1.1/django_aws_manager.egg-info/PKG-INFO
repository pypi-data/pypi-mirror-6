Description: Django AWS Manager
        ==================
        
        Django AWS Manager is a django app that allows you to view and manage Amazon EC2 instances.  It can be useful as a way to access your server quickly from the admin screen and remote desktop.  The servers can be shut off during off hours (e.g., outside of market hours for a trading server) to save costs.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "aws-manager" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'aws-manager',
            )
        
        2. Include the aws_manager URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            url(r'^aws-manager/', include('aws_manager.urls')),
        
        3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the aws-manager models (or add it using south)
        
        4. register the app with your admin in admin.py
        
        5. add a new server record through the admin screen
        
        Usage
        ------
        
        - You can start/stop the server using the admin actions on the aws server list page.
        
        - The server status is visible from the server detail view
        
        - An RDP for remote desktop access file can be downloaded from the detail view if the EC2 server is windows based and is running.
        
        - A management command can be used to start and stop the servers from the command line
        e.g.,
        
        > python manage.py aws-server *servername* start
        
        > Available management commands: start, stop, state, start-wkdays-only, stop-wkdays-only
        
        - Starting and stopping of the servers can be scheduled using chron or heroku scheduler with the management commands
