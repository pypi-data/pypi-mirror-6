        eight: Python 2 to the power of 3
        =================================
        Eight is a Python module that provides a minimalist compatibility layer between Python 3 and 2. Eight lets you write
        code for Python 3.3+ while providing limited compatibility with Python 2.7 with no code changes.  Eight is inspired by
        `six <https://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_, but is more lightweight, easier to use, and unambiguously biased toward Python 3
        code: if you remove eight from your code, it will continue to function exactly as it did with eight on Python 3.
