                             Optimal Stellar Models (OSM)

OSM is a python program that implements the Levenberg-Marquardt method for the calculation of optimal stellar models with the CESTAM code. The minimization takes into account fundamental constraints as well as seismic constraints. Cross-correlations between the seismic constraints are also take into account in the minimization criterion. 

* Requirements:

- CESTAM (version 3.2 or newer) : a free code for the calculation of  the structures and evolutions of stars ;
- python-cestam, a Python library associated with CESTAM (developed by J. Marques), this module is included in the CESTAM package ;
- ADIPLS : a code for computing adiabatic stellar modes (http://astro.phys.au.dk/~jcd/adipack.n/) ;
- Python (2.7 or newer) , Numpy and Scipy. 

* Installation

You must first install CETSTAM and ADIPLS, please refer to their associated documentations. To install OSM in your home directory for you own use, type:
python setup.py install â€“-home=$HOME/

The components of the OSM library will be installed, depending on your architecture, in $HOME/lib/python or $HOME/lib64/python, while the osm.py executable will be installed in $HOME/bin/.

You can also install OSM as root for all the users, in that case type:
sudo python setup.py install
