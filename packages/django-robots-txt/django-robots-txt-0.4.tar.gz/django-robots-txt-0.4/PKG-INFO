        ======
        
        This is a simple application to create a ``robots.txt`` file for django. It has no models at all and you're supposed to edit a template to update the ``robots.txt`` file. I got tired of having to add this view to each and every project because Django doesn't have a built in ``text/plain`` view.
        
        See the `robots page <http://www.robotstxt.org/>`_ for details what the file should look like.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Get ``django-robots-txt`` into your python path::
        
            pip install django-robots-txt
        
        Create your custom robots.txt file in one of your template directories as ``robots_txt/robots.txt``.
        
        Add a ``robots.txt`` view to your root ``urls.py``::
        
            from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, include, url
            from robots_txt.views import RobotsTextView
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                ...,
                url(r'^robots.txt$', RobotsTextView.as_view()),
                ...,
            )
        
        That's it, your robots.txt template will be served.
        
        This urlconf entry is also supported if you prefer to keep it short::
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                ...,
                url(r'', include('robots_txt.urls')),
                ...,
            )
        
        You can add ``robots_txt`` to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py if you don't want to create your own template and don't mind having an empty ``robots.txt``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...,
                'robots_txt',
                ...,
            )
