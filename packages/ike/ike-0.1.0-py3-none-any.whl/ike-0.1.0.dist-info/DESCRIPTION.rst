About ike
=========

The goal of this project is to be a minimalistic IKEv2 (RFC 5996)
implementation in Python.

Status
------

This project is in early stages. Use at own risk.

It will make your IP stack talk ESP to the remote peer.

What it can do:

-  Act as an initiator
-  Authenticate itself and peer using raw RSA keys.
-  Install ESP SAs and SPD entries to use the key material via
   ``setkey`` command from ipsec-tools.

Limitations (hardcoded values):

-  Cipher algorithm is Camellia in CBC mode with 256 bit keys.
-  HMAC / Hash / PRF algorithm is SHA2/256.
-  IKE group is Diffie-Hellman modp 14.
-  Authentication (both own private and peer public) key file paths are
   hardcoded.
-  'setkey' syntax is of whatever the ipsec-tools on Debian 7.1 accept.
-  Traffic selectors are myip:any:0-65535 <-> peerip:any:0-65535

Design principles
-----------------

-  Minimal amount of code.
-  Support *MUST* features of draft-kivinen-ipsecme-ikev2-rfc5996bis-02
   (RFC 5996 successor)
-  Use strongest algorithms possible.

Documentation
-------------
