"""
Provides a system for monitoring the progress of a multiprocess batch
job through a queue.  As worker processes or threads complete jobs,
they place objects into the queue. When they exit, they place None on
the queue.  The consumer thread removes objects from the queue,
optionally updating a progress indicator as it does so.  When it has
received a number of Nones equal to the number of workers, the job is
complete.  One advantage of this method is that the batch can be
prematurely terminated (typically through a shared variable) and the
consumer won't block indefinitely.
