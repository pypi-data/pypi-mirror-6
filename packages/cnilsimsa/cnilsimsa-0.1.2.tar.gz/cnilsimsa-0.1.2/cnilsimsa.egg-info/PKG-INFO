Description: # cNilsimsa
        
        A C implementation of Nilsimsa for Python.
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install cnilsimsa
        ```
        
        We are building this module one piece at a time. So far, that means only
        `compare_hexdigests` because needing a faster way to do that was the
        primary motivation to start this project.
        
        ```python
        from cnilsimsa import compare_hexdigests
        ```
        
        It works exactly like the method of the same name from pynilsimsa but
        is more than an order of magnitude faster, so if you need to do lots of
        deduplication over a large corpus of documents via nilsimsa hex digests
        from Python, this should be helpful.
        
        Building out the rest of of the methods for representing and cooking 
        LSHs to provide a full drop-in replacement for pynilsimsa is the longer
        term goal.
        
        ```python
        import cnilsimsa as nilsimsa
        ```

        Thanks to the authors of the Ruby/C implementation from which our
        our `fillpopcount()` function is taken.

        Thanks to the Perl/C implementation that inspired both predecessors.
