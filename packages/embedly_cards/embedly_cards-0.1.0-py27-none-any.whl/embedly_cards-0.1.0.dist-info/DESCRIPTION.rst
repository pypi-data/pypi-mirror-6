Embedly-Cards
===============

Embedly-cards is a Pelican_ plugin providing restucturedText directives to allow
easy embedding of external content using `Embed.ly Cards <http://embed.ly/cards>`_.

.. _Pelican: http://getpelican.com


Features
============
Embed content within a page or blog post easily, simply by specifying the URL of
the target page. Content is automatically recognised, extracted, and formatted as
a 'card'; this may contain a short article preview, embedded video, picture etc.

To preview a card, they can be generated online using `Embed.ly <http://embed.ly/cards>`_.
Almost any site is compatible, including YouTube, Flickr, Google+, Maps, Wordpress etc.

Installation
============
Embedly-cards can be installed using `pip`

.. code-block:: bash

	$ pip install embedly-cards

or manually from the source code

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python setup.py install

Once installed, simply add it to your `pelicanconf.py` configuration file:

.. code-block:: python

	PLUGINS = [
	    # ...
	    'embedly_cards'
	]


Usage
============

In order to embed content within a restucturedText blog post/article, you can use
the `embedly-card` directive.

For example, to embed a YouTube video,

.. code-block:: ReST

	.. embedly-card:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlfIVEy_YOA

Or to embed an article/webpage:

.. code-block:: ReST

	.. embedly-card:: http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/5265/cooling-a-cup-of-coffee-with-help-of-a-spoon

Options
========

The `card-chrome` option, if provided, specifies whether or not to preserve the
border around the card. By default, the border will be removed automatically
*if Embed.ly supports it*; however to force the border to remain, you may pass
``:card-chrome: 1``:

.. code-block:: ReST

	.. embedly-card:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlfIVEy_YOA
		:card-chrome: 1
