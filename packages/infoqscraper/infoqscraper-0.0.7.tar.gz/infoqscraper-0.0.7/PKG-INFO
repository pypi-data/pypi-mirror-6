Description: 
        InfoQ hosts a lot of great presentations, unfortunately it is not possible to watch them outside of the browser.
        The video cannot simply be downloaded because the audio stream and the slide stream are not in the same media.
        
        infoqscraper allows to scrap the website, download the required resources and build a movie from them.
