        ============
        
        pyxform is a Python library that makes writing XForms for ODK Collect and enketo
        easy by converting XLS(X) spreadsheets into XForms. A new user of pyxform should
        look at the documentation `here <https://formhub.org/syntax/>`_ or
        `here <http://opendatakit.org/help/form-design/xlsform/>`_.
        
        pyxform is used by `opendatakit.org <http://opendatakit.org>`_ and by `formhub.org <http://formhub.org>`_.

        Chage Log
        =========
        (since `v0.89
        <https://github.com/modilabs/pyxform/tree/39097db3da789fef9e33a6680df1e912dd29c5db>`_)
        
        - Added support for submission_url and public_key settings.
        - Added alternative syntax (\::) for grouping headers.
        - Added new example/test spreadsheets: (xlsform_spec_test.xls, calculate.xls, warnings.xls)
        - xls_to_dict in xls2json_backends.py now converts everything (including numbers and booleans) to trimmed unicode values.
          (This solves the issue with labels not being able to be numbers).
        - Aliases added (see *_alias dictionaries in xls2json.py)
        - xls2json code can collect warnings into an array and print them to a file.
        - Some errors and warnings have row numbers
        - Merged jbeorse's base.xls with modilabs's base.xls into all.xls
        - Fixed translations for media and hints
        - Added media back in
        - Added table-lists
        - Automatic none option for select all that apply is off by default.
        - Adding json_form_schema.json to document the json format.
          (Perhaps it could be used for validation or form generation at some point).
