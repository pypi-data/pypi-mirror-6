Release History
===============

0.0.4 (2014-03-08)
------------------

- Add logic for pluggable objects to manage the flow-control window for both
  connections and streams.
- Raise new ``HPACKDecodingError`` when we're unable to validly map a
  Huffman-encoded string.
- Correctly respect the HPACK EOS character.

------------------

- Use bundled SSL certificates in addition to the OS ones, which have limited
  platform availability. (`Issue #9`_)

  them to be reused. Note that they may not be reused if exceptions are thrown
  when they're in use: you must open a new connection in that situation.

- The ``HTTP20Adapter`` correctly reuses connections.
- Stop sending WINDOWUPDATE frames with a zero-size window increment.
- Provide basic functionality for gracelessly closing streams.
