When to use Oraide
##################

Oraide works best used when your demo is performed in a controlled terminal session that relies only on keyboard input.
For example, Oraide has been used to demonstrate running a script, ``make``, and editing source code with ``vim``.
Oraide can make your presentation better if you're willing to put in the time to prepare and practice ahead of time.

Oraide doesn't work well in situations where you need to do a lot of context switching.
For example, Oraide would not work well when you need to switch between a terminal and a web browser repeatedly.
Oraide may not help your presentation if you want to work extemporaneously,
improvising your presentation based on live data or audience participation (for example, a Q&A session).

If it sounds like Oraide may be useful to you, continue reading :ref:`the tutorial <tutorial>`.
