        Orbit
        ===========
        
        Orbit provides an easy way to get a number of values, such as current latitude and longitude, from objects in space. Currently, any object with a corresponding Two Line Element (TLE) can be tracked. A list of supported objects is available from Celestrack at <http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/master.asp>. Usage looks like:
        
            from orbit import satellite
            
            # 25544 is the idenfier for the International Space Station
            # See http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/master.asp for an index
            # of identifiers.
            
            iss = satellite(25544)
            
            # Get the current lat/long of the satellite
            iss_current_latitude = iss.lat()
            iss_current_longitude = iss.long()
            
            # Get the proper name of the satellite
            iss_name = iss.name()
            
            # Get the elsat classificiation of the satellite
            iss_elsat_classification = iss.elsat_classification()
            
            # Get the year the satellite launched
            iss_launch_year = iss.launch_year()
            
            # Get the current TLE for the satellite
            iss_tle = iss.tle()
            
            # Get the current elevation of the satellite
            iss_elevation = iss.elevation()
            
            # True if the satellite is currently in the earth's shadow
            iss_eclipsed = iss.eclipsed()
