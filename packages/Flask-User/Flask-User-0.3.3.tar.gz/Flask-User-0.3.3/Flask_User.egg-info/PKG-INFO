        ==========
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        | Many Flask websites require the registration, authentication, and management of users.
        | Each website often requires different customization of this process.
        
        Flask-User aims to provide a robust package that offers:
        
        * **Reliable** and **Feature Rich** user management functionality,
        * **Ready to use** after an easy install and setup, and
        * **Fully customizable** through well documented config settings and attributes, and
        * **Secure** password hashing and token encryption and signing.

        This package is relatively new. We are looking for alpha testers to give us feedback
        on how it behaves in different usage scenarios. If something doesn't work the way
        you expect it to work, please take the time to email ling [at] gmail.com and help us
        reach outstanding quality quickly. Thanks!
        
        We're also welcoming feature requests. In particular, we would like to know if there's
        a need out there for database adapters other than the SQLAlchemyAdapter.
