        Spectroscopy Made Hard
        =======
        
        :Info: See the `GitHub repository <http://github.com/andycasey/smh/tree/master>`_ for the latest source
        :Author: `Andy Casey <acasey@mso.anu.edu.au>`_ (acasey@mso.anu.edu.au)
        :License: Don't distribute. This code is only given out to good friends.
        
        
        This code can be used to measure the stellar parameters and detailed
        chemical abundances of a star from high-resolution spectroscopic data,
        using a traditional curve-of-growth analysis, and incorporating `MOOG
        <http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html>`_.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - You will require the `Enthought Python Distribution
          <http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php>`_ (use the
          32-bit version only). This code is free for academic use, but you may
          need to `register using your institution email address
          <https://www2.enthought.com/accounts/register/?next=/licenses/academic>`_.
        
        - The non-interactive version of `MOOG
          <http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html>`_, known as ``MOOGSILENT``. As
          long as you have the appropriate command line tools, you can install
          ``MOOG`` and ``MOOGSILENT`` using ``pip``:
        
            ``sudo pip install moog``
        
          (If you don't have ``pip`` installed, you can install it with
          ``easy_install pip`` and then use ``easy_install`` any time you would
          have used ``pip``, `see here why
          <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install>`_.)
        
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The best way to download the code is to use ``git``. If you don't have
        ``git``, you can `download it for free <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_. 
        Make sure you follow the setup instructions `here <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git>`_ 
        to make things easier for yourself in the future. If you are asked for a 
        password when trying to use the ``sudo`` command, then you should enter 
        your administrator password for your machine, not your GitHub
        account password. Once ``git`` is set up, use the following command in a 
        terminal:
        
            ``git clone git@github.com:andycasey/smh.git smh``
        
        That will clone the entire repository into a fresh folder called ``smh``.
        Whenever there is a new version of the code or a bug-fix, you can download
        the latest copy by ``cd``'ing to your ``smh`` directory then using:
        
            ``git pull``
        
        And that's it! If you encounter unexpected bugs, please copy the entire
        stack trace (error log) you get into a new `GitHub issue
        <https://github.com/andycasey/smh/issues/new>`_ along with
        a detailed description of what you were trying to do when the error
        occurred.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Unless you've set up an alias, just ``cd`` to your ``smh`` directory then use:
        
            ``python main.py``
        
        
        Wiki
        ----
        
        There is an `incomplete Wiki <https://github.com/andycasey/smh/wiki>`_ (that you can contribute to) which takes you
        through all the analysis steps in SMH.
