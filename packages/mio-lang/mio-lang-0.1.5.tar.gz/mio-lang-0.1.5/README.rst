mio is a minimalistic IO programming language written in the
`Python Programming Language`_ based on MIo (*a port from Ruby to Python*)
in the book `How To Create Your Own Freaking Awesome Programming Language`_ by
`Marc-Andre Cournoye`_.

This project is being developed for educational purposes only and should serve as
a teaching tool for others wanting to learn how to implement your own programming
language (*albeit in the style of Smalltalk, Io, etc*). Many thanks go to `Marc-Andre Cournoye`_
and his wonderful book which was a great refresher and overview of the overall processing
and techniques involved in programming language design and implementation. Thanks also go to the
guys in the ``#io`` channel on the FreeNode IRC Network specifically **jer** nad **locks**
for their many valuable tips and help.

The overall goal for this project is to create a fully useable and working programming language
implementation of a langauge quite similar to `Io <http://iolanguage.com>`_ with heavy influence
from `Python <http://python.org>`_ (*because Python is awesome!*). This has already largely been
achived in the current version. See the `RoadMap <http://mio-lang.readthedocs.org/en/latest/roadmap.html>`_
for what might be coming up next.

Installation
------------

The simplest and recommended way to install mio is with pip.
You may install the latest stable release from PyPI with pip::

    > pip install mio-lang

If you do not have pip, you may use easy_install::

    > easy_install mio-lang

Alternatively, you may download the source package from the
`PyPI Page`_ or the `Downloads page`_ on the `Project Website`_;
extract it and install using::

    > python setup.py install

You can also install the
`latest-development version <https://bitbucket.org/prologic/mio-lang/get/tip.tar.gz#egg=mio-lang-dev>`_ by using ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::
    
    > pip install mio-lang==dev

or::
    
    > easy_install mio-lang==dev


For further information see the `mio documentation <http://mio-lag.readthedocs.org/>`_.
