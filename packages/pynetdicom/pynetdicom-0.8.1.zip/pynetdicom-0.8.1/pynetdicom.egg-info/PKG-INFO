        pynetdicom is a pure python package implementing the DICOM network
        protocol.  Working with pydicom, it allows DICOM clients (SCUs) and
        servers (SCPs) to be easily created.  DICOM is a standard
        (http://medical.nema.org) for communicating medical images and related
        information such as reports and radiotherapy objects.
              
        The main class is AE and represent an application entity. User
        typically create an ApplicationEntity object, specifying the SOP
        service class supported as SCP and SCU, and a port to listen to. The
        user then starts the ApplicationEntity which runs in a thread. The use
        can initiate associations as SCU or respond to remote SCU association
        with the means of callbacks.
