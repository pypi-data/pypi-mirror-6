Change log
==========

1.0 2014-02-04 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Declare the API stable and release version 1.0.

* Support python 2.6 (issue #8). The doctests don't pass because
  OrderedDict isn't available until 2.7.

0.4 2014-02-04 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Add docstring (issue #7).

* Fixed README.txt typos (thanks pombredanne on bitbucket).

0.3 2014-01-29 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Removed documentation left over from recordtype.

* Make instances unhashable (issue #2).

* Reorganize code for name checking. No functional changes.

* Make instances iterable (issue #3).

* Add collections.Sequence ABC (issue #4).

* Have "python setup.py test" also run doctests (issue #5).

0.2 2014-01-28 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Added MANIFEST.in.

* Hopefully fixed a problem with .rst formatting in CHANGES.txt.

0.1 2014-01-28 Eric V. Smith
----------------------------

* Initial release.

* Based off my recordtype project, but uses ast generation instead of
  building up a string and exec-ing it. This has a number of advantages:

  - Supporting both python2 and python3 is easier. exec has the
    anti-feature of having different syntax in the two languages.

  - Adding additional features is easier, because I can write in real
    Python instead of having to write the string version, and deal
    with all of the escaping and syntax errors.

* Added FACTORY, to allow namedlist to work even with mutable defaults.
