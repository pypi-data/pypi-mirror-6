Description: Tool for benchmarking Elasticsearch nodes.
        
        The two primary uses are for capacity planning (guessing how much oomph you
        need to do what what you think you need to do), and for performance tuning
        (trying out various index, mapping, and query settings in a consistent and
        reproducible manner).
        
        An Elasticsearch index is composed of a set of 1 or more Lucene indexes
        (designated as primary and replica 'shards' by ES). A single Lucene index is
        the basic unit on which indexing and search operations are executed, and so
        the performance of individual Lucene indexes largely determines the
        performance of a cluster.
        
        The basic approach is to create an index with 1 primary and no replica shards
        (a single Lucene index), load it with data, and periodically run
        representative use patterns against it, recording observations, adding more
        data until the performance drops below acceptable levels.
        
        This tool comes with 'batteries included'. See the README.md file, or even
        better, the project's github page.
