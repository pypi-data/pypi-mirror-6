<h2>Version 2.5.1<a class="headerlink" href="#version-2-5-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Not released yet. <em>Planned release date late November 2013</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The minimum required Python version is now 2.6.x. While Django 1.4.x supports
Python 2.5, Python 2.5 is itself no longer supported by the Python Foundation
neither by several third party apps, and supporting it requires an increasing
number of ad-hoc patches on Pootle, so support for Python 2.5 on Pootle has
been dropped.</li>
<li>The minimum required Django version is 1.4.x.</li>
<li>The database schema upgrade procedure has been redefined, and the
<a class="reference internal" href="server/commands.html#commands-updatedb"><em>updatedb</em></a> management command has been phased out in favor of
South&#8217;s own <a class="reference external" href="http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/commands.html#commands" title="(in South v0.8)"><em class="xref std std-ref">migrate command</em></a>.  Post schema upgrade
actions have been moved to the <a class="reference internal" href="server/commands.html#commands-upgrade"><em>upgrade</em></a> command. For detailed
instructions, read the <a class="reference internal" href="server/upgrading.html"><em>upgrading</em></a> section of the
documentation.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="server/commands.html#commands-setup"><em>setup</em></a> management command was added to hide the
complexities in the initialization or upgrading of the DB when either
upgrading or installing Pootle. Please read the <a class="reference internal" href="server/upgrading.html"><em>upgrading</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="server/installation.html"><em>installation</em></a> sections of
the documentation.</li>
<li><em>css/custom/custom.css</em> is now served as part of the common bundle.</li>
<li>The quality check for spell checking has been globally disabled. It wasn&#8217;t
properly advertised nor documented, and it didn&#8217;t perform well enough to be
considered useful.</li>
<li>Pootle now supports tags that can be added to translation projects or
individual files, and supports filtering translation projects by their tags.</li>
<li>Pootle now supports goals that can be applied to files. It is possible to
apply goals globally in a given project. Goals allow managers to provide a
simple way to prioritize work and keep track of the translation progress in a
group of files.</li>
<li>Pootle allows custom scripts to be exposed in the Actions menu for a project.</li>

<h2>Version 2.5.0<a class="headerlink" href="#version-2-5-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Major release, released on May 18th 2013.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The minimum required Django version is 1.3.</li>
<li>Static files are now handled by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django.contrib.staticfiles</span></tt> module.
This means you will need to run the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pootle</span> <span class="pre">collectstatic</span></tt> command on
production and serve the <em>pootle/assets/</em> directory from your webserver at
<em>/assets/</em>. If you are upgrading from a previous version, you will need to
replace the occurrences of <em>static</em> with <em>assets</em> within your web server
configuration.</li>
<li>Static files are bundled into assets by using <a class="reference external" href="http://elsdoerfer.name/docs/django-assets/">django-assets</a>.</li>
<li>Several features from translation projects have been merged into the
<em>Overview</em> tab, including quality check failures and directory- and
file-level actions. As a consequence the <em>Review</em> tab has been dropped and
the <em>Translate</em> tab serves solely to display the actual translation
editor.</li>
<li>Settings have been migrated from <em>localsettings.py</em> into <em>settings/*.conf</em>
files. Your customizations now go in a <a class="reference internal" href="server/settings.html#settings-customizing"><em>separate configuration file</em></a> (or in <em>settings/90-local.conf</em> if running from a
repository clone).</li>
<li>A new setting, <a class="reference internal" href="server/settings.html#std:setting-VCS_DIRECTORY"><tt class="xref std std-setting docutils literal"><span class="pre">VCS_DIRECTORY</span></tt></a> has been added, and VCS repositories
are located in that directory, separate from the translation files used for
editing and upload/download. The files in the VCS directory should never have
any uncommitted changes in them, except during commit operations themselves.</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PootleServer</span></tt> script has been phased out in favor of a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pootle</span></tt>
runner script.</li>
<li>If you will be using Pootle with Django 1.3, you <em>have</em> to keep the timezone
on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">UTC</span></tt>, unless you are using PostgreSQL. Users of PostgreSQL or Django
1.4 or later are free to set the time zone as they prefer.
Also make sure to use the minimum required South version when performing
database upgrades.</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">update_from_templates</span></tt> management command has been renamed to
<a class="reference internal" href="server/commands.html#commands-update-against-templates"><em>update_against_templates</em></a>.</li>

<h2>Version 2.1.6<a class="headerlink" href="#version-2-1-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bugfix release, released on April 13th 2011.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This is the first version that is compatible with Django 1.2.5 and
Django 1.3.</li>
<li>You also need Translate Toolkit 1.9.0 to be able to use these newer
versions of Django.</li>

<h2>Version 2.1.1<a class="headerlink" href="#version-2-1-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bugfix release, released on September 3rd 2010.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The default cache backend is now a database backend. Memcached is
still the preferred cache backend, but consider using the database cache
if you are using the local memory backend and can&#8217;t use memcached.</li>
<li>You can perform a <a class="reference internal" href="server/database_migration.html#database-migration"><em>database migration away from SQLite</em></a>.</li>

<h2>Version 2.1<a class="headerlink" href="#version-2-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Released on August 17th 2010.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pootle no longer depends on statsdb and SQLite.</li>
<li>Files on disk are only synced with the database on download or commit.
The old behaviour can be restored at the cost of performance.
A <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">manage.py</span></tt> <a class="reference internal" href="server/commands.html#commands"><em>command</em></a> can sync to files on the
command line.</li>
<li>The database is now much larger. This should have no negative impact
on performance, but we strongly suggest using MySQL or PostgreSQL
for the best performance.</li>
<li>Pootle 2.1 will upgrade the database automatically from Pootle 2.0
installations. You need to have South installed. Install it from your
distribution, or <a class="reference external" href="http://south.aeracode.org/">http://south.aeracode.org/</a> or with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">easy_install</span> <span class="pre">South</span></tt>
(the upgrade could take quite a while, depending on your installation size).</li>
<li>Pending files are not used for suggestions any more, and will also be
migrated to the database during upgrade.</li>
<li>New settings are available in <cite>localsettings.py</cite> &#8211; compare your
existing one to the new one.</li>
<li>Pootle 1 installations can easily migrate everything excluding project
permissions. We encourage administrators to configure permissions with
the new permission system which is much simpler to use, since permissions
on the language and project level are now supported.</li>
<li>Have a look at the optimization guide to ensure your Pootle runs well.</li>

<h2>Version 2.0<a class="headerlink" href="#version-2-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Released on December 7th 2009.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pootle now uses the Django framework and data that previously was stored
in flat files (projects, languages, users and permissions) is now stored
in a database. Migration scripts are provided.</li>
<li>Review all suggestions before migrating, and note that assignments
are not yet supported in Pootle 2.0.</li>

<p>Released on October 8th 2008.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The name of the directory for indexing databases changed from

<div class="section" id="version-1-0">
<h2>Version 1.0<a class="headerlink" href="#version-1-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Released on May 25th 2007.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>XLIFF support</dt>
<dd>Pootle 1.0 is the first version with support for XLIFF based projects.
In the admin interface the project type can be specified as PO / XLIFF
(this really just tells Pootle for which type of files it should look -
it won&#8217;t convert your project for you). This property is stored in
<cite>pootle.prefs</cite> in the variable <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">localfiletype</span></tt> for each project.</dd>
<dt>Configurable logos</dt>
<dd>You are now able to configure the logos to use in <cite>pootle.prefs</cite>. At the
moment it will probably be easiest to ensure that the same image sizes
are used as the standard images.</dd>
<dt>Localized language names</dt>
<dd>Users can now feel more at home with language names being localized.
This functionality is actually provided by the toolkit and your system&#8217;s
iso-codes package.</dd>
<dt>Treestyle: gnu vs nongnu</dt>
<dd>Pootle automatically detects the file layout of each project. If you want
to eliminate the detection process (which can be a bit slow for big
projects) or want to override the type that Pootle detected, you can
specify the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">treestyle</span></tt> attribute for the project in <cite>pootle.prefs</cite>.
Currently this can not be specified through the admin interface.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-11">
<h2>Version 0.11<a class="headerlink" href="#version-0-11" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Released on March 8th 2007.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the user has the appropriate privileges (ovewrite right) he/she will
be able to upload a file and completely overwrite the previous one.
Obviously this should be done with care, but was a requested feature for
people that want to entirely replace existing files on a Pootle server.</li>
<li>The server administrator can now specify the default access rights
(permissions) for the server. This is the rights that will be used for
all projects where no other setup has been given. See pootle.prefs for
some examples.</li>
<li>The default rights in the default Pootle setup has changed to only
allow suggesting and to not allow translation. This means that the default
server setup is not configured to allow translation, and that users must
be specifically assigned the translate (and optionally review) right, or
alternatively, the default rights must be configured to allow translation
(see the paragraph above).</li>
<li>The baseurl will now be used, except for the <cite>/doc/</cite> directory, that
currently still is offered at <cite>/doc/</cite>.</li>
<li>The default installation now uses English language names in preperation
for future versions that will hopefully have language names translated
into the user interface language. To this end the language names must be
in English, and names with country codes must have the country code in
simple noun form in brackets. For example <cite>Portuguese (Brazil)</cite>; in other
words, not <cite>Portuguese (Brazilian)</cite>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-10">
<h2>Version 0.10<a class="headerlink" href="#version-0-10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Released on August 29th 2006.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Statistics</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The statistics pages are greatly reworked.  We now have a page that shows
a nice table, that you can sort, with graphs of the completeness of the
files.  This is the default view.  What is confusing is that the stats
page does not work directly with editing.  To get the editing features,
click on the editing link in the top bar.</p>
<p class="last">The quick statistics files (<cite>pootle-projectname-zu.stats</cite>) now also
store the fuzzy stats that are needed to render the statistics tables.
Your previous files from 0.9 can not supply this information. Pootle 0.10
will automatically update these files, but if you (for some reason)
want/need to go back to Pootle 0.9, you will have to delete these files.
Not all <cite>.stats</cite> files need to be deleted, only the ones starting with
<cite>pootle-projectname</cite>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SVN and CVS committing</dt>
<dd>You can now commit to SVN or CVS.  A default commit message is added, you
cannot edit this message.  Your ability to commit depends on the rights
you have on the checkout and since you cannot supply a password it needs
to be a non-blocking method.  This feature is probably not useful for a
very public server unless it is managing multiple translations of your
own project and you have direct control over it and CVS/SVN accounts.
It will work well in a standalone situation like a <a class="reference external" href="mailto:Translate&#37;&#52;&#48;thon">Translate<span>&#64;</span>thon</a> etc,
where it is a public event but the server is controled by yourself for
the event and then you can simply commit changes at the end.
For more information, see version control information.</dd>
<dt>Terminology</dt>
<dd>Pootle can now aid translators with terminology. Terminology can be
specified to be global per language, and can be overriden per project
for each language. A project called &#8220;terminology&#8221; (with any full name)
can contain any files that will be used for terminology matching.
Alternatively a file with the name <cite>pootle-terminology.po</cite> can be put
in the directory of the project, in which case the global one (in the
terminology project) will not be used. Matching is done in real time.
Note that this does not work with GNU-style projects (where all the
files are in one directory and have names according to the language code).</dd>
<dt>Translation Memory</dt>
<dd>Pootle can now aid translators by means of a translation memory. The
suggestions are not generated realtime &#8211; it is done on the server by
means of a commandline program (<cite>updatetm</cite>). Files with an appended <cite>.tm</cite>
will be generated and read by Pootle to supply the suggestions. For more
information see <cite>updatetm</cite>.</dd>
