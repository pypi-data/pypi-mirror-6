Description: NyanBar - a Nyan Cat progress bar for python
        
        Example:
        
        progress = NyanBar()
        # do some work
        progress.update(20) # update always takes where you are now
        progress.finish()
        
        
        Or...
        
        progress = NyanBar(tasks=100)
        # do some work.
        progress.task_done()
        # do many more tasks...
        progress.finish()
        
        
        Or... if you happen to have a specific MP3 file, famous or not.
        
        progress = NyanBar(audiofile="/path/to/NyanCat-original.mp3")
        progress.update(20)
        ...
        progress.finish()
        
        
        You can also use progress in a with statement which will call
        `finish()` for you:
        
        with NyanBar(tasks=10, audiofile="/path/to/NyanCat-original.mp3") as progress:
            progress.task_done()
            ... more
        
        (You'll need to be on OSX and have afplay, or on Linux and have
        mpg123 or mplayer)
