django-campaign - A basic newsletter app for the Django webframework
====================================================================

Django-campaign is an application for the Django webframework to make 
sending out newsletters to a rather small group of subscribers easy.
It is not a solution to drive your multi-thousand-subscriber campaigns, but 
a few hundred - maybe a few thousand - subscribers should be possible.

Some of the core features are:

* Multipart Emails made easy - just add a plain-text *and* a html-template.
* Full control over the Subscriber-Model and therefore the template context
  used to render the mails.
* Add context processors to add whatever you need to a mail template based on
  the recipient. This makes it easy to personalize messages.
* View the campaigns online
* German translation for the app (at least for all releases)
* simple and optional subscribe/unsubscribe handling

Planned features:

* easy i18n support for the emails
* every recipient should be able to see his personalized message online
