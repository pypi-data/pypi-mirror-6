Installing django-campaign
==========================

This document describes how to install django-campaign.

Quickstart
----------

1. Install django-campaign with ``easy_install``::

    easy_install django-campaign
    
2. Add ``campaign`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'campaign',
        ...
    )
    
3. Add an entry to your URL-conf. Using ``campaign`` here is a matter of taste,
   feel free to mount the app under a different URL::

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        (r'^campaign/', include('campaign.urls'))
    )
    
4. Then run ``manage.py syncdb`` to create the neccessary database tables.
    
Manual Install
--------------
    
Instead of using ``easy_install`` to install the latest release you can also
run a svn checkout of the recent development version. Just checkout the code
and add the folder ``campaign`` to your PYTHONPATH, for example by copying or
symlinking the folder to your site-packages directory.

Downloading a release, unpacking and adding the folder to the PYTHONPATH is, 
of course, also possible.

After you have added the folder to the PYTHONPATH follow the instructions under
Quickstart_ above starting at point 2.
