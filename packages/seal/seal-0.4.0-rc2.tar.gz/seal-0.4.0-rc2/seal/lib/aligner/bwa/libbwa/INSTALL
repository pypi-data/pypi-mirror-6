Simply type `make' to compile and copy the resulting executable `bwa'
anywhere you want. You may also like to copy `solid2fastq.pl' and
`qualfa2fq.pl' for format conversion.

On 32-bit system, you should compile bwa with `make CFLAGS=-O2'.

The GNU building system is also supported, which is necessary for
building Java binding. Nonetheless, directly runing `make' is
recommended in most other cases.
