Description: WHS Ltd provides collection of pure-python modules.
        
        This is implementation of lock, that allows only one kind of operation be
        executed at the time (reading or writing). Any number of callers
        can acquire reading or writing at once, but if someone tries to acquire writing
        while reading is acquired, it will wait, until all readers that acquired lock
        release it (and vice versa).
        
        At the moment it works only with threading, but few simple modifications will
        result in multiprocessing-enabled implementation.
        
        whs.utils.rwlock is a package, but should be used as a module (all code is in
        __init__.py).
