Description: Sixpack
        =======
        
        Python client library for SeatGeak's Sixpack_ ab testing framework.
        
        .. _Sixpack: http://github.com/seatgeek/sixpack
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        First install in your virtual environment::
        
            $ pip install sixpack-client
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Basic example::
        
        
            from sixpack.sixpack import Session
        
            session = Session()
        
            # Participate in a test (creates the test if necessary)
            session.participate("new-test", ["alternative-1", "alternative-2"])
        
            # Convert
            session.convert("new-test")
        
        Each session has a `client_id` associated with it that must be preserved across requests. Here's what the first request might look like::
        
            session = Session()
            resp = session.participate("new-test", ["alternative-1", "alternative-2"])
            set_cookie_in_your_web_framework("sixpack-id", session.client_id)
        
        
        You can then make decisions in your application based on resp['alternative']['name']::
        
            session = Session()
            resp = session.participate("new-test", ["alt-1", "alt-2"])
            if resp["alternative"]["name"] == "alt-1":
                set_variable_in_view("new-test-alternative", "alt-1")
        
        For future requests, create the `Session` using the `client_id` stored in the cookie::
        
            client_id = get_cookie_from_web_framework("sixpack-id")
            session = Session(client_id=client_id)
            session.convert("new-test")
        
        Sessions can take an optional `options` dictionary that takes `host` and `timeout` as keys. This allows you to customize Sixpack's location.::
        
            options = {'host': 'http://mysixpacklocation.com'}
            session = Session(client_id="123", options=options)
        
        If Sixpack is unreachable or other errors occur, sixpack-py will provide the control alternative.
