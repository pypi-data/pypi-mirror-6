Welcome to Dragon Mapper
========================

Dragon Mapper is a Python library that provides identification and conversion
functions for Chinese text processing:

* Identify a string as Traditional or Simplified Chinese, Pinyin, or Zhuyin.
* Convert between Chinese characters, Pinyin, Zhuyin, and the International
  Phonetic Alphabet.

This is Dragon Mapper's documentation. You probably want to start with
:doc:`installation`. Then, check out :doc:`tutorial` and :doc:`api`.

request, please submit it via the `GitHub Issues page
