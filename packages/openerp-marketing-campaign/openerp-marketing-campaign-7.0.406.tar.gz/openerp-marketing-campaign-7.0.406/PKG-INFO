Description: 
        
        This module provides leads automation through marketing campaigns (campaigns can in fact be defined on any resource, not just CRM Leads).
        =========================================================================================================================================
        
        The campaigns are dynamic and multi-channels. The process is as follows:
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
            * Design marketing campaigns like workflows, including email templates to
              send, reports to print and send by email, custom actions
            * Define input segments that will select the items that should enter the
              campaign (e.g leads from certain countries.)
            * Run you campaign in simulation mode to test it real-time or accelerated,
              and fine-tune it
            * You may also start the real campaign in manual mode, where each action
              requires manual validation
            * Finally launch your campaign live, and watch the statistics as the
              campaign does everything fully automatically.
        
        While the campaign runs you can of course continue to fine-tune the parameters,
        input segments, workflow.
        
        **Note:** If you need demo data, you can install the marketing_campaign_crm_demo
              module, but this will also install the CRM application as it depends on
              CRM Leads.
