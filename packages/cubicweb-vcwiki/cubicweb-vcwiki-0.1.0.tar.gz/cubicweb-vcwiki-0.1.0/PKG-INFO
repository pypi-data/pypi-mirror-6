        Version controlled wiki component for the CubicWeb framework
        
        Currently, to use, you need the following steps:
        
        1. The administrator must create a `Repository` entity and set its `path`
           attribute to a valid path to a Mercurial repository (which must be created
           beforehand).
        
        2. The administrator must add write permissions for the `Repository`, via
           the `localperms` cube (action available at the left of the screen).
        
        3. The administrator must perform a "Refresh repository" action, also available
           at the left of the screen.
        
        4. Create a `VcWiki` entity and set `rst` as default extension.
        
        5. You should be able to create your wiki homepage through the `wiki homepage`
           action on the left.
