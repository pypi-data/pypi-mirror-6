Description: nsplist
        
            nsplist is a package that provides a parser for the NeXTSTEP plist
            text-based format. A common usage is parsing iTunes In App Purchase
            receipts to be able to reject them early, without having to make a
            request to the iTunes API.
        
            This is distinct from the Apple plist format, which has more
            supported types and serialises to XML or binary.
        
        
        Examples:
        
            >>> import nsplist
            >>> print nsplist.loads('{"x" = "1"; "y" = "2";}')
            {u'x': u'1', u'y': u'2'}
