Description: Intoduction
        =============
        
        collective.slideshare does not add any new contenttypes. It adds new
        views for your `Link` and `File` (currently archetypes only) contenttypes.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        You have to configure collective.slideshare first to be able to use it.
        It requires an API KEY and a SHARED SECRET. Additionally you may provide
        a username and password. If you do not provide usermane and password
        you will be prompted for those every time you upload a file to slideshare.
        You can obtain an API KEY at http://www.slideshare.net/developers/applyforapi
        
        You can specify a policy for this behaviour:
        
        * Always use the credentials provided, never prompt user for input
        * Always ask user for his credentials
        * Allow user to supply his credentials, if none are provided use the system credentials
        
        Files can be automatically uploaded to SlideShare_ when you 'publish'
        them. For this to work a workflow must be activated for Files and you
        have to provide credentials and the policy must not require the user
        to supply his own credentials.
        
        
        Links
        -----
        
        When you add a link to a SlideShare_ presentation the product retrieves the
        slideshare_id from SlideShare_ and embeds the presentation in your page.
        Do NOT use the link given in the slideshare `<> Embed` option!
        You can (de)activate the 'SlideShare View' at any time.
        
        
        Files
        -----
        
        When you upload a Presentation you can change the view to 'SlideShare View'.
        You will then be asked to provide your credentials to add this file to
        SlideShare_ and the presentation will be embedded in the page. At
        First you may see a 'This document has either been removed or made private by
        its owner' message. This is to be expected as SlideShare_ needs a little
        time to convert the presentation. Refresh the page after a little while.
        
        Slideshow was removed from SlideShare_
        ---------------------------------------
        
        When a presentation is removed from SlideShare_ you can simply change the
        view back to the default view. However this does not remove the id from
        the annotation. To remove the annotation you have to call
        `Remove Slideshare Annotation` in the `Actions` menu
        or manually append `@@slideshare_removeid.html` to your objects url.
        
        This does *NOT* delete the presentation from SlideShare.
        It is not recommended to remove the id if you do not delete the
        presentation from SlideShare, because if you change the view back to
        `SlideShare View` it will result in another upload of the presentation.
