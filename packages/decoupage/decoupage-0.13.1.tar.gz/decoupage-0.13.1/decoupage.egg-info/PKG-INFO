Description: decoupage
        =========
        
        what is it?
        -----------
        
        `decoupage` is a *dynamic* file server that allows for index pages
        configurable with genshi templates and .ini files.  I mainly wrote it
        because i was tired of using apache for serving my website and
        generating index.html files by hand.  Decoupage provides views into
        the filesystem.
        
        
        how do i use it?
        ----------------
        
        Set up a `paste <http://pythonpaste.org>`_ .ini file that specifies the
        directory to serve (``decoupage.directory``) and, optionally, a
        configuration file .ini file (``decoupage.configuraton``) which
        specifies the labels for the files based on directory. An example of a
        `paste <http://pythonpaste.org>`_ .ini file is in
        ``decoupage.ini``. Note the ``[app:decoupage]`` section::
        
            [app:decoupage]
            paste.app_factory = decoupage.factory:factory
            decoupage.directory = %(here)s/example
            decoupage.configuration = %(here)s/example.ini
        
        The labels for files are in ``example.ini``, specified by sections as
        directories::
        
            [/]
            foo.txt = a file about cats
        
            [/cats]
            lilly.txt = lilly
            hobbes.txt = a file about Hobbes
        
        You can specify the entire layout from here.  Alternately, you can
        have an ``index.ini`` in a directory which, if present, overrides the
        default configuration.  Such a file is in the ``fleem`` subdirectory
        of ``example``::
        
            /template = index.html
            fleem.txt = some fleem for ya
        
        Try it out!  Install decoupage and run ``paster serve decoupage.ini``
        and point your browser to the URL it gives you.
        
        
        how do i do more with decoupage?
        --------------------------------
        
        Since filenames can't start with a ``/`` (just try it!), the
        functionality of decoupage may be extended with ``/`` commands in a
        section.  This is done by adding a setuptools ``entry_point`` to
        ``[decoupage.formatters]``.  See the decoupage ``setup.py`` and
        ``decoupage.formatters`` for examples.  For instance, 
        
        Running `decoupage-formatters` from the command line gives the list of
        formatters that are available (which are pluggable setuptools extension points
        at [decoupage.formatters]).  For example: /include = site.html could
        include the site.html genshi template at the top of the body.
        
        Formatters:
        
        sort: 
            determines how to sort the files in a directory; 
            right now only by case-insensitive alphabetically
            * reverse : reverse the order of the sorting
            
        all: 
            only pass files of a certain pattern; 
            the inverse of ignore
            calling all with no arguments means only files with descriptions
            are used
            
        title: 
            splits a description into a title and a description via a
            separator in 
            the description.  The template will now have an additional
            variable, 
            'title', per file
            Arguments:
            * separator: what separator to use (':' by default)
        
        describe: 
            obtain the description from the filename
            the file extension (if any) will be dropped and
            spaces will be substituted for underscores
            
        ignore: 
            ignore files of a glob patterns.  
            These files will not be linked to in the template.
            e.g. /ignore = .* *.pdf  # don't list dotfiles and PDFs
            
        include: include a file at the top of the body
        css: specify CSS used (whitespace separated list)
        
        Decoupage also makes use of other special intrinsic keywords:
        
        formatters: ordered list of formatters to apply
        
        inherit: inherit configuration from a certain directory (instead of
        the parent
        
        transform: a list of transformers for contenttransformer
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
         * allow transformers to be configurable on a per-directory basis
         * add a ``?format=rss`` query string argument
         * add a ``?template=foo.html`` query string argument
