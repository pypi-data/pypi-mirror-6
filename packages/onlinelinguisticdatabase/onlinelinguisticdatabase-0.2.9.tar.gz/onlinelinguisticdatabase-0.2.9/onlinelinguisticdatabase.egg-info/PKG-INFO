        OnlineLinguisticDatabase
        ================================================================================
        
        The Online Linguistic Database (OLD) is software for creating web applications
        dedicated to multi-user, collaborative documention of natural (and usually
        endangered or understudied) languages. An OLD web application helps contributors
        to create a consistent, structured, and highly searchable web-based repository
        of language data. These data consist of textual representations of linguistic
        examples (words, morphemes, and sentences with analyses and annotations),
        associated and embedded media files, and exportable representations of texts
        (e.g., research papers, narratives, etc.)
        
        See a demo OLD application at
        `www.onlinelinguisticdatabase.org <http://www.onlinelinguisticdatabase.org>`_.

        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        #. Multi-user, concurrent read/write access to a server-side language database.
        #. Interlinear glossed text (IGT) representations of data with integrated
           feedback on lexical consistency or morphological analyses.

        Versions
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Note that there are currently two distinct versions of the OLD: 0.2.X and 1.0.
        
        Version 0.2.X is a standard Pylons web application. Its source can be found on
        GitHub at https://github.com/jrwdunham/old-webapp.
        
        Version 1.0. includes functionality for creating morphological parsers,
        provides improved search functionality, and implements a shift to a more
        modular and reusable architecture (i.e., a RESTful HTTP/JSON web service with a
        SPA GUI). However, there is currently no GUI for the OLD 1.0. Its source can be
        found on GitHub at https://github.com/jrwdunham/old.
        
        While version 0.2.X is still being maintained, primary development has moved to
        version 1.0.
        
        
        Get, Install & Serve
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        When installing the OLD 0.2.X, it is recommended that you use an isolated Python
        environment using
        `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html>`_.
        (Note that the OLD 0.2.X has been tested with Python 2.5 and 2.6, but not 2.7.
        Depending on your system Python version, it may be necessary to install Python
        2.5 or 2.6 using `pyenv <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv>`_ or
        `pythonbrew <https://github.com/utahta/pythonbrew>`_.) Once ``virtualenv`` is
        installed, issue the following commands to create the isolated environment and
        to make sure you are using its Python::
        
            virtualenv env
            source env/bin/activate
        
        To install with ``easy_install``::
        
            easy_install "OnlineLinguisticDatabase==0.2.9"
        
        With ``Pip``::
        
            pip install "OnlineLinguisticDatabase==0.2.9"
        
        To create the config file, generate the default values, and serve the application::
        
            mkdir my_old_webapp
            cd my_old_webapp
            paster make-config onlinelinguisticdatabase production.ini
            paster setup-app production.ini
            paster serve production.ini
        
        
        Using MySQL
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        The default configuration (``.ini``) file  uses a local SQLite database, which
        is probably fine for exploring the system initially. However, a deployed OLD
        0.2.X application should use MySQL.
        
        First login to MySQL using your root account and create a MySQL database and a
        user with sufficient privileges.  Something like this (replacing ``dbname``,
        ``username``, and ``password`` with sensible values)::
        
            mysql> create database dbname default character set utf8;
            mysql> create user 'username'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
            mysql> grant select, insert, update, delete, create, drop on dbname.* to 'username'@'localhost';
            mysql> quit;
        
        Then comment out the SQLite option in the OLD 0.2.X configuration file (e.g.,
        ``production.ini``) and uncomment the two MySQL lines, changing values as
        appropriate::
        
            sqlalchemy.url = mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/dbname
            sqlalchemy.pool_recycle = 3600
        
        Now the system is set up to use MySQL. Run the ``setup-app`` command again to
        generate the default values in the MySQL db::
        
            paster setup-app production.ini
        
        See `The Pylons Book <http://pylonsbook.com/>`_ for further details on serving
        and configuring Pylons-based web applications.
        
        
        Default Users
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Running ``paster setup-app`` creates three users with the following usernames
        and passwords.
        
        - username: ``admin``, password: ``admin``
        - username: ``contributor``, password: ``contributor``
        - username: ``viewer``, password: ``viewer``
        
        Use the admin account to create a new administrator-level user and delete all
        of the default users before deploying an OLD application.
        
        
        Common Issues
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Note that if you are running Debian or Ubuntu and get an error like
        ``EnvironmentError: mysql_config not found`` after running
        ``python setup.py develop``, then you probably need to install
        ``libmysqlclient-dev``::
        
            sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
        
        If you get an error page when using the browser-based interface, re-saving the
        system settings should solve it. I.e., go to Settings > System Settings > Edit
        System Settings and click the "Save Changes" button.
