Description: ========
        coinshot
        ========
        
        A simple Python module for Pushover.net
        
        Example
        =======
        See example.py for full example::
        
            from coinshot import Coinshot, CoinshotException
        
            coinshot_object = Coinshot(application_key[, user_key])
        
            coinshot_object.push(message[, title, user_key, device, url, url_title, priority, timestamp])
        
        Notes
        =====
        * ``user_key`` is required either during object initialization or when calling push. If a ``user_key`` is provided for both, the one passed to push takes precedent.
        * ``url_title`` can be passed without ``url``, but will be ignored
        
        What's the deal with the name?
        ==============================
        The name coinshot is derived from a class of characters from Brandon
        Sanderson's Mistborn book series. Coinshot Allomancers "burn" steel to Push
        nearby metals.
