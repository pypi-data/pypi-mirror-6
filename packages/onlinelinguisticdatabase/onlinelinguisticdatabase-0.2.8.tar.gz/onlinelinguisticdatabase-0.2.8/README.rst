The Online Linguistic Database (OLD) is software for creating web applications
dedicated to multi-user, collaborative documention of natural (and usually
endangered or understudied) languages. An OLD web application helps contributors
to create a consistent, structured, and highly searchable web-based repository
of language data. These data consist of textual representations of linguistic
examples (words, morphemes, and sentences with analyses and annotations),
associated and embedded media files, and exportable representations of texts
(e.g., research papers, narratives, etc.)


Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. Multi-user, concurrent read/write access to a server-side language database.
#. Interlinear glossed text (IGT) representations of data with integrated
   feedback on lexical consistency or morphological analyses.
#. Powerful searches over the data set.
#. Authentication and authorization to control access to data.
#. Export to LaTeX, CSV, and plain text.
#. Media file support: many-to-many associations of audio, video, and/or image
   with content embedded in data representations.
#. IGT text creation.
#. Automatic orthography conversion.
#. Inventory-based transcription input validation.


Versions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the OLD v. 0.2.X. It is being used in nine language-specific OLD web
applications (see www.onlinelinguisticdatabase.org) and is still being
maintained. However, primary development has moved to the
`OLD v. 1.0<https://github.com/jrwdunham/old>`_, which includes support for
creating morphological parsers, provides improved search functionality, and
implements a shift to a more modular and reusable architecture (i.e., a RESTful
HTTP/JSON web service with a SPA GUI). The applications running on the OLD v.
0.2.X will be migrated to the OLD v. 1.0 in the near future.


License
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The OLD 0.2.X is open source and is licensed under the
`GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3<https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_.
(Note that the OLD 1.0 is also open source but is licensed under
`Apache 2.0 <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt>`_.


Technologies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The OLD is written in Python, using the
`Pylons <http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pylons-framework/about>`_ web
framework and an `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ abstraction over a
MySQL database.


Get & Install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the OLD 0.2.X locally for or testing purposes, it is recommended that
you use an isolated Python environment, which can be created using
`virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html>`_.
(Note that the OLD 0.2.X has been tested with Python 2.5 and 2.6, but not 2.7.
Depending on your system Python version, it may be necessary to install Python
2.5 or 2.6 using `pyenv <https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv>`_ or
`pythonbrew <https://github.com/utahta/pythonbrew>`_.)

Run the following commands to get, install, and configure the OLD v. 0.2.X. 
(Note that the first two lines are relevant only if you are using a virtual
environment.)::

    virtualenv --no-site-packages env
    source env/bin/activate
    git clone https://github.com/jrwdunham/old-webapp.git
    cd old-webapp
    python setup.py develop
    paster setup-app development.ini
    paster serve --reload development.ini

The default configuration file (``development.ini``) uses a local SQLite
database named ``development.db``, which is probably fine for exploring the
system. A deployed OLD 0.2.X application should use MySQL. After creating a
MySQL database and a user with sufficient privileges, comment out the SQLite
option in the OLD 0.2.X configuration file and uncomment the two MySQL
lines.::

    sqlalchemy.url = mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/dbname
    sqlalchemy.pool_recycle = 3600

See `The Pylons Book <http://pylonsbook.com/>`_ for further details on serving
and configuring Pylons-based web applications.
