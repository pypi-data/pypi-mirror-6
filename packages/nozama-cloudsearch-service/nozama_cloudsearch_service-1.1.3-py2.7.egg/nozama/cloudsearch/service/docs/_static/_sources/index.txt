Introduction
------------

The aim of this project is to emulate the Amazon CloudSearch interface for
local testing purposes. I don't intend this project to be used as a replacement
for cloud search.

I wanted to test a platfom that was hardcoded to use only cloudsearch. There
was no way I could change the code in question. I was also unable to get other
instances due to budget constraints. I looked around for alternatives and found
none I could get working on CentOS.


Alternative projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I came across Groonga CloudSearch which implements a local instance of Amazon
CloudSearch. I tried hard to get it to work on CentOS and Ubuntu. Sadly it
didn't work for me. Its NodeJS codebase needs updating. Something I don't have
the time to learn and try.

It may be worth keeping and eye on incase it comes to life again.
