Tayrakit is a browser toolkit using Tayra templating language. Most popular
toolkits are written entirely as javascript libraries that are normally fetched
when a page gets loaded. Tayrakit adapts the opposite way. Widgets,
also called as template plugins, are authored using a templating language so
that html parts are kept as HTML, css parts are kept as CSS and JavaScript is
used only where it is required - for event callbacks :)
