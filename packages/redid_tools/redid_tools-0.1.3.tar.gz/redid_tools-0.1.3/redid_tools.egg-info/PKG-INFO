Description: Redid CLI Tools
        ===============
        
        The Redid CLI tools provide a simple way to work with the Redid service.
        
        ::
        
            pip install redid_tools
        
        After install you will need to configure the tools. This simply sets the
        account information needed to connect to Redid.
        
        ::
        
            redid setup
        
        You can check that your credentials are correct by running the
        ``check-auth`` command.
        
        ::
        
            redid check-auth
        
        redid
        -----
        
        ``redid`` offers a command line interface to much of the REST API. Use
        ``redid --help`` to see a list of options and commands.
        
        redid-sync
        ----------
        
        ``redid-sync`` synchronizes a local directory to a remote Redid path.
        This is a relatively quick and simple way to store resources.
        
        ::
        
            redid-sync local/path/ remote/prefix/
        
        The files from ``local/path/`` will be uploaded as resources to
        ``remote/prefix/``. For example, a file named ``local/path/sunset.jpg``
        will be uploaded to the resource named ``remote/prefix/sunset`` witha
        content-type of ``image/jpeg``.
        
        The synchronization tool does not upload a file if the binary hash
        matches the one already on the server. This makes it relatively quick to
        make small changes and rerun synchronization. If you however need to
        upload the same file a lot for testing, you might wish to use
        ``redid upload-resource`` instead. ``redid-sync`` always has to list the
        remote resources first, which could be a bit slow for repeated quick
        use.
        
        Files starting with a ``.`` are not uploaded.
        
        The local path will be recursively scanned and the entire tree uploaded.
        
        .redid.yaml
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can control the behaviour of synchronization with the
        ``.redid.yaml`` file, located in the root of your local synchronization
        folder. For example, ``local/path/.redid.yaml``.
        
        remote\_delete\_missing
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        By default ``redid-sync`` will not delete remote resources that do not
        exist locally. This is a safety feature to prevent accidental deletion.
        To enable remote delete set the ``remote_delete_missing`` option to
        True:
        
        ::
        
            remote_delete_missing: True
        
        ext\_map
        ^^^^^^^^
        
        The file type of a local file will be guessed (using Python's
        ``mimetypes`` module, and a few extra rules). If you have special files
        that should be uploaded with a different content-type you can use the
        ``ext_map`` entry. This is a map of extension to content-type.
        
        ::
        
            ext_map:
                ".bin": image/x-private-binary
                ".xpng": image/ping
        
        To get the resource name of a resource this extension will be dropped.
        For example ``document.bin`` will be uploaded as resource ``document``
        with the content-type ``image/x-private-binary``.
        
        Just let us know if you need any other mapping features.
