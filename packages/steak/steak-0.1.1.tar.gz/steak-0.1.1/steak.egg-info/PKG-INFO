        ========
        
        **Simplify writing and executing repetitive tasks.**
        
        Steak is a minimal and powerful utility for collecting all of your
        mindless, repetitive tasks into a single, brilliantly-named
        ``steakfile``. As an evolution of
        `bumpy <https://github.com/scizzorz/bumpy>`__, steak focuses on the same
        design principles - minimize friction when writing tasks and provide a
        simple CLI interface to execute your tasks.
        
        Inspired by tools like `nose <https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/>`__,
        steak allows you to write plain Python functions which will be
        automatically discovered and prepared for execution. By inspecting your
        function signatures, steak learns as much as it can and provides a
        simple and understandable command line interface to your tasks without
        requiring any extra effort on your end.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Write a ``steakfile`` / ``grill.py``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Toss the code below in a ``steakfile`` or ``grill.py``.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            def build():
                '''Builds ALL THE CODE.'''
                print('Building...')
        
            def run():
                '''Runs ALL THE PROGRAMS.'''
                build()
                print('Running...')
        
            def clean():
                '''Cleans ALL THE GARBAGE.'''
                print('Cleaning...')
        
        Execute your tasks
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Just call the included ``grill`` command-line tool to run your tasks.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ grill build
            Building...
            $ grill run
            Building...
            Running...
            $ grill clean
            Cleaning...
        
        Execute several tasks
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Give multiple space-separated task names to ``grill`` to execute them
        all.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ grill build run
            Building...
            Running...
        
        Notice that ``grill`` tries to avoid repeating task execution, so it
        only runs the ``build`` task once! You can explicitly run a task
        multiple times.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ grill build build run
            Building...
            Building...
            Running...
        
        Save some keystrokes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Steak will allow you to abbreviate command names as much as you want,
        but if there's ambiguous tasks, the task selection behavior is
        unreliable.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ grill b r
            Building...
            Running...
        
        Get some help
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you invoke ``grill`` with no arguments, an automatic help message
        will be printed out.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ grill
            build
                Builds ALL THE CODE.
            clean
                Cleans ALL THE GARBAGE.
            run
                Runs ALL THE PROGRAMS.
