Description: Fluent Unit Testing
        ===================
        
        *Readable hybrid testing*
        
        Why?
        ~~~~
        
        This is an attempt to make Python testing more readable while maintaining a
        Pythonic look and feel.  As powerful and useful as the `unittest`_ module is,
        I've always disliked the Java-esque naming convention amongst other things.
        
        While truly awesome, attempts to bring BDD to Python never feel *Pythonic*.
        Most of the frameworks that I have seen rely on duplicated information between
        the specification and the test cases.  My belief is that we need something
        closer to what `RSpec`_ offers but one that feels like Python.
        
        Where?
