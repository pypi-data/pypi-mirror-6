<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The script <a class="reference external" href="./otu_category_significance.html">otu_category_significance.py</a>
tests whether any of the OTUs in an OTU table are significantly associated with
a category in the category mapping file. This code uses ANOVA, the G test of
independence, Pearson correlation, or a paired t-test to find OTUs that are
differentially represented across experimental treatments or measured variables.</p>
<p>The script can also be used to measure co-occurrence. For instance it can also
be used with presence/absence or abundance data for a phylogenetic group (such
as that determined with quantitative PCR) to determine if any OTUs co-occur
with a taxon of interest, using the ANOVA, G test of Independence, or
correlation.</p>
<p>One useful feature is to be able to run otu category significance across
all taxonomic levels of an OTU table. For example, you can take your otu_table.biom
and run <a class="reference external" href="./summarize_taxa.html">summarize_taxa.py</a> on it, which will create an output directory that
contains your OTU table summarized at different taxonomic levels, with the
file names containing L2, L3, L4 etc. to designate different taxonomic
resolutions. This script allows you to &#8220;sweep&#8221; over those taxonomic levels
contained within the directory by passing -i input_directory. This
output will then contain an individual results file that
is written for each summarized taxa table. Note for QIIME 1.6: the input
directory that you pass to this script must contain biom tables. Thus, you
might need to convert your summarized taxa tables that are in the classic OTU
table form to biom tables using the <a class="reference external" href="http://biom-format.org/documentation/biom_conversion.html">biom convert</a> command.</p>
<p>If you run <a class="reference external" href="./multiple_rarefactions_even_depth.html">multiple_rarefactions_even_depth.py</a> on your OTU table, you may
want to run otu_category_significance on each table and then collate the results
achieved from each table. In order to do this, simply pass the directory as the
input filepath, and then pass the -w collate option. See usage examples below.</p>
<p>The statistical test to be run is designated with the -s option, and includes
the following options:</p>
<p>The G test of independence (g_test): determines whether OTU presence/absence is
associated with a category (e.g. if an OTU is more or less likely to be present
in samples from people with a disease vs healthy controls).</p>
<p>ANOVA (ANOVA): determines whether OTU relative abundance is different between
categories (e.g. if any OTUs are increased or decreased in relative abundance in
the gut microbiota of obese versus lean individuals).</p>
<p>Pearson correlation (correlation): determines whether OTU abundance is
correlated with a continuous variable in the category mapping file. (e.g. which
OTUs are positively or negatively correlated with measured pH across soil samples)</p>
<p>The tests also include options for longitudinal data (i.e. datasets in which
multiple samples are collected from a single individual or site.) The composition
of microbes may differ substantially across samples for reasons that do not
relate to a study treatment. For instance, a given OTU may not be in an
individual or study site for historical reasons, and so cannot change as a
result of a treatment. The longitudinal tests thus ignore samples from individuals
in which a particular OTU has never been observed across samples. The category
mapping file must have an &#8220;individual&#8221; column indicating which sample is from
which individual or site, and a &#8220;reference_sample&#8221; column, indicating which
sample is the reference sample for an individual or site (e.g. time point zero
in a timeseries experiment). The longitudinal options include:</p>
<p>Pearson correlation (longitudinal_correlation): determines whether OTU
relative abundance is correlated with a continuous variable in the category
mapping file while accounting for an experimental design where multiple samples
are collected from the same individual or site. Uses the change in relative
abundance for each sample from the reference sample (e.g. timepoint zero in
a timeseries analysis) rather than the absolute relative abundances in the
correlation (e.g. if the relative abundance before the treatment was 0.2, and
after the treatment was 0.4, the new values for the OTU relative abundance will
be 0.0 for the before sample, and 0.2 for the after, thus indicating that the
OTU went up in response to the treatment.)</p>
<p>Paired t-test (paired_T): This option is when measurements were taken &#8220;before&#8221;
and &#8220;after&#8221; a treatment. There must be exactly two measurements for each
individual/site. The category mapping file must again have an individual column,
indicating which sample is from which individual, and a reference_sample column,
that has a 1 for the before time point and a 0 for the after.</p>
<p>With the exception of longitudinal correlation and paired_T, this script can be
performed on a directory of OTU tables (for example, the output of
<a class="reference external" href="./multiple_rarefactions_even_depth.html">multiple_rarefactions_even_depth.py</a>), in addition to on a single OTU table.
If the script is called on a directory, the resulting p-values are the average
of the p-values observed when running a single test on each otu_table
separately. It is generally a good practice to rarefy the OTU table
(e.g. with <a class="reference external" href="./single_rarefaction.html">single_rarefaction.py</a>) prior to running these significance tests
in order to avoid artifacts or biases from unequal sample sizes.</p>

[default: ANOVA]</dd>
<dt>-f, <cite>-</cite>-filter</dt>
<dd>Minimum fraction of samples that must contain the OTU for the OTU to be included in the analysis. For longitudinal options, is the fraction of individuals/sites that were not ignored because of the OTU not being observed in any of the samples from that individual/site. [default: 0.25]</dd>

<dt>-z, <cite>-</cite>-reference_sample_column</dt>
<dd>This column specifies the sample to which all other samples within an individual are compared. For instance, for timeseries data, it would usually be the initial timepoint before a treatment began. The reference samples should be marked with a 1, and other samples with a 0.</dd>

If a filepath is given with the -b option this converted OTU table will be saved to this path.</dd>
<dt><cite>-</cite>-relative_abundance</dt>
<dd>Some of the statistical tests, such as Pearson correlation and ANOVA, convert the OTU counts to relative abundances prior to performing the calculations. This parameter can be set if a user wishes to disable this step. (e.g. if an OTU table has already been converted to relative abundances.)</dd>
<dt>-w, <cite>-</cite>-collate_results</dt>
<dd>When passing in a directory of OTU tables, this parameter gives you the option of collating those resulting values. For example, if your input directory contained multiple rarefied OTU tables at the same depth, pass the -w option in order to find the average p-value for your statistical test over all rarefied tables and collate the results into one file. If your input directory contained OTU tables that contained different taxonomic levels, filtering levels, etc then do not pass the -w option so that an individual results file is created for every input OTU table.
