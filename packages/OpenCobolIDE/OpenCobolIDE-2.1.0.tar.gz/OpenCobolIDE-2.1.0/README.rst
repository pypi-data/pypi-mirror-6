Disclaimer
--------------------

I am by no way a cobol expert, I just had to work on a cobol project at school
with an awful IDE (NetExpress on a Windows Xp virtual machine). As I was writing
pyqode, I thought it would be nice to use it to make a simple cobol editor for
GNU/Linux.

I've only learnt COBOL 74 and the IDE has been thought with this standard in
mind. I have personally no plan on working with cobol at the moment nor to learn
a new standard but if you found a missing feature, feel free to open a feature
request. I'm always looking forward to make OpenCobolIDE better for the experts.

Your advice will be very appreciated!
