    An abstract class with the methods required for a comparison
    operation. A comparison method consists of the following
    operations:

    1. Loading data from files. Some preprocessing may be necessary
    (e.g. computing spectrograms, denoising).

    2. Making pairwise comparisons and outputting statistics of the
    comparison.

    The symmetric property should be True if d(A,B)==d(B,A)

        preprocessed, and returned in a form ready for pairwise
        comparison.  IMPORTANT: the data are stored in shared memory
