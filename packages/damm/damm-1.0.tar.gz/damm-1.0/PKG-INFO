Description: Damm algorithm decimal check digit
        ----------------------------------
        
        Note that check digits are NOT used for verification of data transfers between
        computers -- use a CRC or a hash for that purpose! Check digits are used to
        check *manual* entry of a digit into a computer system.
        
        A Damm check digit is a single check digit that can detect any
        single-digit error as well as any adjacent-digit transpositions. The digit
        computed in this module also detects some important phonetic errors (13<->30,
        14<->40, ... 19<-->90).
        
        This makes the Damm check digit better than other, more well-known check digits
        like the Luhn code (used in credit cards) and the ISBN base-11 check digit. It
        is equal in detection strength to a Verhoeff check digit, but much simpler to
        compute.
        
        Furthermore, a hexadecimal Damm check digit was added. This single hexadecimal
        check digit that detects every single-digit error as well as any adjacent-digit
        transpositions. The digit computed in this module also detects some important
        phonetic errors (13<->30, 14<->40, ... 19<-->90). It also detects all
        jump-transposition errors (abc -> cba), 93.5 % of all twin digit errors (aa ->
        bb) and 93.5 % of all jump twin digit errors (aca -> bcb).
        
        There are four functions in this module: `encode`, `encode16`, `check` and
        `check16`. The first two, `encode` and `encode16` are used to calculate the
        check digit for a number that you have. Pass in a string with the number you
        want encoded and get a string with the check digit back. The other two, `check`
        and `check16` are used to check that a number that was entered was entered
        correctly. Pass in a string with a number including check digit and get back
        `True`/`False`.
        
        
        Damm algorithm
        --------------
        
        The Damm check digit is computed by starting with a check digit of zero and then
        continually multiplying this check digit with the digits of a given number,
        using the multiplication of a totally anti-symmetric quasigroup. The properties
        and the selection of the group ensure the qualities of the check digit stated
        above.
