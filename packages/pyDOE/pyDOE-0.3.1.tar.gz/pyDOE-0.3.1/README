=====================================================
``pyDOE``: The experimental design package for python
=====================================================

The ``pyDOE`` package is designed to help the 
**scientist, engineer, statistician,** etc., to construct appropriate 
**experimental designs**.

Capabilities
============

The package currently includes functions for creating designs for any 
number of factors:

- *Factorial Designs*

  #. **General Full-Factorial** (``fullfact``)

  #. **2-level Full-Factorial** (``ff2n``)

  #. **2-level Fractional Factorial** (``fracfact``)

  #. **Plackett-Burman** (``pbdesign``)

- *Response-Surface Designs* 

  #. **Box-Behnken** (``bbdesign``)

  #. **Central-Composite** (``ccdesign``)

- *Randomized Designs*

  #. **Latin-Hypercube** (``lhs``)
  
*See the* `package homepage`_ *for details on usage and other notes*

What's New
==========

In this release, the Plackett-Burman constructor has been simplified to 
require only the number of factors: ``pbdesign(n)``. The design is now able 
to grow as large as necessary to accomodate any number of factors.

Also, the factorial designs (``ff2n``, ``fracfact``, and ``pbdesign``) have 
all been standardized (except for ``fullfact``, which needs the flexibility) 
to have coded levels -1 and 1 for the low and high levels.

Requirements
============

- NumPy
- SciPy
