Description: 
        Painter
        -------
        
        Painter is an ANSI coloring library heavily based on the awesome
        `chalk <https://github.com/sindresorhus/chalk>`_ library for Node.js along
        with all its dependences.  However, painter attempts to provide an even more
        expressive API which reads like English.
        
        Painter is fully tested with 100% coverage and also completely Flake8
        compilant too!
        
        Quick Start
        ```````````
        
        Install Painter in your virtualenv as follows:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install painter
        
        And now, go ahead and use it to output colors to your terminal:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from __future__ import print_function
        
            from painter import paint
        
            # Simple printing of colors
            print('Welcome to Painter!', paint.red('I can paint things red'),
                  paint.blue('and blue'))
        
            # Chaining colors
            print(paint.blue.on_red.bold.underline('and far more complex combos too'))
            print()
        
            # Nested painting
            print(paint.on_red('I can also use a background color across',
                               paint.blue('multiple'),
                               paint.yellow('foreground colors')))
        
            # Custom separator
            print(paint('and', 'allow', 'you to use', paint.red('custom separators'),
                  sep='-'))
            print()
        
            # Creating themes
            cool_theme = paint.green.on_red.underline.bold
            print('Creating', cool_theme('your own theme'), 'is easy')
        
            # Easily disable painting of colors
            paint.enabled = False
            print('and I allow you to easily', paint.red('disable'), paint.blue('me'))
            print()
        
            paint.enabled = True
            print('Hope you have a', paint.blue('lovely day!'), paint.green(':)'))
