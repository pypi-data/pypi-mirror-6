MENU DESIGN
===========

This document is intended to document the design decisions regarding PyBan's
menus. First are the more general ideas, then the actual requirements.

Design principles
=================

* To minimize clutter, only necessary menu items should be shown.

* VIM-like key commands should be the primary means of navigation.

* The keys should be easy to remember

* The menu should be able to fit the width of the terminal window,
  even on small windows.


Menu requirements
=================

* Only the help command is shown at any one time.

* Depending on what screen the user is on when issuing the help command,
  different, context sensitive, help screens will be shown.
