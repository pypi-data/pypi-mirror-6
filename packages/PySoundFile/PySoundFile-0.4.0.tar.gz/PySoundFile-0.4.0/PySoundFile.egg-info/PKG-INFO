Description: 
            PySoundFile can read and write sound files.
        
            PySoundFile can read and write sound files. File reading/writing is
            supported through libsndfile_, which is a free, cross-platform,
            open-source library for reading and writing many different sampled
            sound file formats that runs on many platforms including Windows, OS
            X, and Unix. It is accessed through CFFI_, which is a foreight
            function interface for Python calling C code. CFFI is supported for
            CPython 2.6+, 3.x and PyPy 2.0+. PySoundFile represents audio data as
            NumPy arrays.
        
            You must have libsndfile installed in order to use PySoundFile.

            Note that you need to have libsndfile installed in order to use
            PySoundFile. On Windows, you need to rename the library to
            "sndfile.dll".
