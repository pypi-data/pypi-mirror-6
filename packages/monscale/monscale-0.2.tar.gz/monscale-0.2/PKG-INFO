        ========
        
        Daemond that monitor services and acts on them based on rules. Monscale is a Django
        project.
        
        
        The project resides mainly in two commands, the monitor and the actions executor.
        The monitor is a loop that retrieves from the DB the info about the MonitoredServices.
        
        Each MonitoredService is the relation of:
        
            - A metric.
            - A condition for that metric
            - A time the condition must be True
            - An action must be triggered if the condition was True more seconds than the 
            shown by the threshold.
            
        When an action is triggered, its queued in a Redis list.
        
        The Action Executor is a daemon that collects the actions queued at the Redis list 
        and executes them.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        First install the Python module. This command will install every Python dependency.
        
        ```
        pip install monscale
        ```
        
        Note that monscale uses Redis list to store some of its operational data, therefore either
        install Redis and get it running, or use a predeployed Redis server.
        
        Don't forget to set the SQL DB configuration found at the path:
        
        ```
        <python-libs>/monscale
        ```
