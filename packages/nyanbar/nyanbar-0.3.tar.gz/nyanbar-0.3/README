NyanBar - a Nyan Cat progress bar for python

Example:

progress = NyanBar()
# do some work
progress.update(20) # update always takes where you are now
progress.finish()


Or...

progress = NyanBar(tasks=100)
# do some work.
progress.task_done()
# do many more tasks...
progress.finish()


Or... if you happen to have a specific MP3 file, famous or not.

progress = NyanBar(audiofile="/path/to/NyanCat-original.mp3")
progress.update(20)
...
progress.finish()


You can also use progress in a with statement which will call
`finish()` for you:

with NyanBar(tasks=10, audiofile="/path/to/NyanCat-original.mp3") as progress:
    progress.task_done()
    ... more

(You'll need to be on OSX and have afplay, or on Linux and have
mpg123 or mplayer)
