        Installation
        ------------
        
        We are at the cheese-shop: ::
        
            pip install django_forest
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        In order to use django_forest in your project:
        
        1. Include `mptt` and `forest` in your `INSTALLED_APPS` settings.
        2. Enable `django-admin`.
        3. In your terminal, type: `python manage.py syncdb`
        4. Followed by: `python manage.py runserver`
        5. Point your browser to `localhost:8000/admin`
        6. Create a few `Pages`: Pages are defined as well, web-pages only that in context of django_forest, they contain `Widgets`.
        7. Create a few `Widgets`: Little boxes that point to a URL. The URL is used to get a partial-HTML rendered from a server or JSON which is then rendered into HTML client-side using `handlebar.js` templates.
        8. And finally we have `Templates`: If you haven't guessed already, these are client-side `handlebar.js` snippets that will get their context from the JSON at the URL defined in the `Widget`.
        9. The above arrangement is all you need to make composite pages. There is room for improvement: For instance, the `gridster.js` that allows for drag-and-drop functionality does not currently serialize its state to the server. However, I intend to iron-out these niggles in the coming release.Watch this space.
