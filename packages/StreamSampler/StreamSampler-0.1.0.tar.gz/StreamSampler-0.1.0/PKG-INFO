Description: StreamSampler
        =============
        
        StreamSampler package allows you to sample a particular number of elements from
        a stream of data of which length is very large or unknown.
        
        StreamSampler is provided in both forms of an executable command and library.
        It utilizes Reservoir sampling algorithm [`Vitter85`_]
        
        You can take a look at the README.txt of other projects, such as repoze.bfg
        (http://bfg.repoze.org/trac/browser/trunk/README.txt) for some ideas.

        * `sample-cli`_ by Paul Butler is a command line tool providing almost the same feature. StreamSampler is intended to be a library, although it has a command line interface, so that it can be a part of other packages including my future projects.
