        This repository contains tools used by the OpenStack Documentation
        project.
        
        For more details, see the `OpenStack Documentation wiki page
        <http://wiki.openstack.org/Documentation>`_.
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        `Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`_ must be installed to build the
        documentation.
        
        To install Maven 3 for Ubuntu 12.04 and later, and Debian wheezy and later::
        
            apt-get install maven
        
        On Fedora::
        
            yum install maven3
        
        
        Contributing
        ============
        Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud computing,
        and encourages you to join the `OpenStack Foundation <http://www.openstack.org/join>`_.
        The best way to get involved with the community is to talk with others online
        or at a meetup and offer contributions through our processes, the `OpenStack
        wiki <http://wiki.openstack.org>`_, blogs, or on IRC at ``#openstack``
        on ``irc.freenode.net``.
        
        We welcome all types of contributions, from blueprint designs to documentation
        to testing to deployment scripts.
        
        If you would like to contribute to the development,
        you must follow the steps in the "If you're a developer, start here"
        section of this page:
        
           http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute
        
        Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
        should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
        the workflow documented at:
        
           http://wiki.openstack.org/GerritWorkflow
        
        Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.
        
        Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:
        
           https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals
