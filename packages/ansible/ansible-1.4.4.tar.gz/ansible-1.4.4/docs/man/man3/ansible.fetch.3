.SH NAME
fetch \- Fetches a file from remote nodes
.\" ------ DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This module works like \fIcopy\fR, but in reverse. It is used for fetching files from remote machines and storing them locally in a file tree, organized by hostname. Note that this module is written to transfer log files that might not be present, so a missing remote file won't be an error unless fail_on_missing is set to 'yes'. 
.\" ------ OPTIONS
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
   
.IP dest
A directory to save the file into. For example, if the \fIdest\fR directory is \fC/backup\fR a \fIsrc\fR file named \fC/etc/profile\fR on host \fChost.example.com\fR, would be saved into \fC/backup/host.example.com/etc/profile\fR(required)   
.IP fail_on_missing
Makes it fails when the source file is missing.
.IR Choices :
yes,no. (default: no)(Added in Ansible version 1.1.)
   
.IP flat
Allows you to override the default behavior of prepending hostname/path/to/file to the destination.  If dest ends with '/', it will use the basename of the source file, similar to the copy module.  Obviously this is only handy if the filenames are unique.(Added in Ansible version 1.2.)
   
.IP src
The file on the remote system to fetch. This \fImust\fR be a file, not a directory. Recursive fetching may be supported in a later release.(required)   
.IP validate_md5
Verify that the source and destination md5sums match after the files are fetched.
.IR Choices :
yes,no. (default: yes)(Added in Ansible version 1.4.)
