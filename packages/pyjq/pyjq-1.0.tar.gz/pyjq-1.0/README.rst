pyjq: Binding for jq JSON Processor
===================================

pyjq is a Python bindings for jq (http://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

    jq is like sed for JSON data â€“ you can use it to slice and filter
    and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed,
    awk, grep and friends let you play with text.

    http://stedolan.github.io/jq/

You can seamlessly call jq script (like regular expression) and process
plain python data structure.

Example
-------

::

    >>> data = dict(
    ...     parameters= [
    ...         dict(name="PKG_TAG_NAME", value="trunk"),
    ...         dict(name="GIT_COMMIT", value="master"),
    ...         dict(name="TRIGGERED_JOB", value="trunk-buildall")
    ...     ],
    ...     id="2013-12-27_00-09-37",
    ...     changeSet=dict(items=[], kind="git"),
    ... )
    >>> import pyjq
    >>> pyjq.first('.parameters[] | {"param_name": .name, "param_type":.type}', data)
    {'param_type': None, 'param_name': 'PKG_TAG_NAME'}

API
---

For jq script, `see its
manual <http://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`__.

Only four APIs are provided. They are ``apply``, ``one``, ``first``,
``compile``.

``apply(script, value, **kw)``
    Transform object by jq script, returning all results as list.
``first(script, value, default=None, **kw)``
    Transform object by jq script, returning the first result. Return
    default if result is empty.
``one(script, value, **kw)``
    Transform object by jq script, returning the first result. Raise
    ValueError unless results does not include exactly one element.
``compile(script, **kw)``
    Compile a jq script, retuning a script object.

Limitation
----------

jq is a JSON Processor. Therefore pyjq is able to process only "JSON
compatible" data (object made only from str, int, float, list, dict).

Install
-------

As usual:

::

    pip install pyjq

For your information, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jq is a also jq
bindings but different and incompatible with pyjq.

Build from source code
----------------------

Build jq
~~~~~~~~

You have to build and install jq library before you build this module.

jq requires following packages:

-  Flex
-  Bison
-  GCC
-  Make
-  Autotools

These will be installed by your system's package manager (apt, yum, or
else).

Checkout source code from github:

::

    git clone https://github.com/stedolan/jq
    cd jq
    git checkout jq-1.3

Where, you can checkout ``master`` branch or newer release than jq-1.3.
However, author of pyjq have not build with any release other than
jq-1.3.

Build and install jq:

::

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Some system have cached list of dynamic link libraries. In such system,
library of jq is not loaded and importing python binding fails.

Command to refresh the cache is system specific. In the case Linux Mint
14:

::

    ldconfig

Install pyjq
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*setuptools* and *cython* are required to build and to install this
module.

You can build and install this module by usual way.

::

    python setup.py install

Q&A
