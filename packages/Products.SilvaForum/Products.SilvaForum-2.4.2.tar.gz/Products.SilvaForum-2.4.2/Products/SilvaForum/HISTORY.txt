  sensible permalinks, going to the topic with an anchor that's the
  comment id.

  topic with an anchor, not to the comment object (which is not very
  useful because there's no context).

  the document title.

- Put in javascript toggle button for a comment form.

- Checked in Marc Petitmermet's code source to the
  SilvaForum-CodeSource branch and added it to Silva Forum code. Added
  a view_include.pt, and include.css to handle the styles of a Silva
  Document with comments. Added to the FiveViewable class a switch to
  check for an 'include' parameter that gets the code source template.

  from the view_topic.pt to the format_text method in view.py.

  replacing links in text area of comments. Also made tests for the
  method.

  recent changes.

  forum.

  the comment will jump to the last page, the same page as where it
  is added.

- forum.css changes, added emoticon preview support to
  view_forum.pt, view_comment.pt subject fields.

  the error on the preview hidden inputs, and re-wrote those to
  support unicode.

- Reverted to static form in view_forum.pt view.
