        An event-based reporting system for django -- With queryset graphs [More on the graphs in this gist](https://gist.github.com/alexlovelltroy/5993250)!
        
        ### Not fit for human consumption.  
        This is a collection of event/reporting code that I've used in various places over the years.  It seems useful enough to share, but I haven't added docs or examples yet.
        
        
        ## Event Features
        * Event reporting in middleware, decorators, and tasks
        * Request recording using middleware, decorators, view Mixins.
        * Organizing requests by user, referer, and browser signature where provided
        * Optional async recording/reporting using celery
        
        ## Reporting Features
        * Logs in the database with management commands to clear old logs
        * Generic queryset graphs (using [flot](http://flotcharts.org) to track _any_ queryset with a date field
