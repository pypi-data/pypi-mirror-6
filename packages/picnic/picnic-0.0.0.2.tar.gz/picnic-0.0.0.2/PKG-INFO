Description: Picnic
        =======
        
        Picnic is a simple template engine for writing python modules. You open a console and in any folder you type ::
            
            picnic.py ModuleName
        
        and it will produce the following folder, with (almost ?) all the files you need. All there is left to do is write the actual code : ::
        
            /ModuleName
                /modulename
                    /__init__.py
                    /modulename.py # A file for the actual code
                /setup.py
                /README.rst
                /LICENCE.txt
                /MANIFEST.in 
                /ez_setup.py # for Setuptools  
        
        The created package is configured to work with Setuptools because Setuptools rocks.
        
        
        
        Options
        --------
        
        Two useful options are ``-git`` and ``-dev`` (the order doesn't matter): ::
            
            picnic.py ModuleName -git -dev
        
        The ``-git`` option will initialize a git repository with the newly created module (requires ``git`` installed): ::
            
            # it will run these lines in the ModuleName folder
            git init
            git add .
            git commit -m "Initial commit"
            # it will also create a python-specific .gitignore file
        
        The ``-dev`` option will run the following command at the end to install the newly created module in *develop* mode (i.e. you can do your changes on the module without needing to reinstall the module each time to test it) ::
            
            sudo python setup.py develop
        
        Installation and customization
        --------------------------------
        
        From the source
        ''''''''''''''''
        
        Get a zip of the code, for instance on Github_ . Unzip the code in some folder. You can check the models of the files ``README.rst``, ``setup.py`` etc in subfolder ``picnic/files`` and change them as you like.
        Then use the following command in the folder where the ``setup.py`` is ::
        
            sudo python picnic.py install
        
        Or even better, use this command instead, it will enable you to change the models of the files even after the installation: :: 
        
            sudo python picnic.py develop
        
        
        With pip (not recommanded)
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        
        Type this in a terminal ::
        
            sudo pip install picnic
        
        The problem with this installation is that you cannot customize the templates.
        
        Test
        '''''
        
        To test if it works go to any folder and type ::
            
            picnic.py TestModule
