0.5.0

 * Deep refactoring of the analyzer API to handle various new usecases, specifically audio feature extraction
 * Add serializable global result container (NEW dependency to h5py, json, yaml)
 * Add new audio feature extraction analyzers thanks to the Aubio library providing beat & BPM detection, pitch dectection and other cool stuff (NEW dependency on aubio)
 * Add new audio feature extraction analyzers thanks to the Yaafe library (NEW dependency on yaafe)

 * EXPERIMENTAL : add new audio feature extraction thanks to the VAMP plugin library (NEW dependency on some vamp toold)
 * Add new documentation : http://files.parisson.com/timeside/doc/
 * New Debian repository for instant install
 * Various bugfixes
 * Comptatible with Python >=2.7
 * WARNING : no longer compatible with Telemeta 1.4.5

0.4.5

 * (re)fix Pillow support (#12)
 * fix some Python package rules
 * add a Debian package directory (thanks to piem, in git repo only)

0.4.4

 * Only setup bugfixes
 * Last compatible version with Python 2.6
 * Next version 0.5 will integrate serious new analyzer features (aubio, yaafe and more)

0.4.3

 * finally fix decoder leaks and de-synchronizations (thanks to piem)
 * this also fixes bad variable encoder file lengths
 * fix OGG and FLAC encoders (closes: #8)
 * fix multi-channels streaming (closes: #13)
 * add support for Pillow (closes: #12)
 * temporally desactivate AAC and WebM encoders (need to add some limits for them)
 * WARNING : we now need to add overwrite=True to encoder kwargs instances in order to overwrite the destination file, i.e. e=Mp3Encoder(path, overwrite=True)

0.4.2

 * many releases these days, but there are some patches which are really worth to be HOT released : we just need them in production..
 * finally fix FFT window border leaks in the streaming spectrum process for *really* better spectrograms and *smoother* spectral centroid waveforms
 * *mv* gstutils to timeside.gstutils
 * cleanup various processes
 * Ogg, Aac and Flac encoders not really working now (some frames missing) :( Will be fixed in next release.

0.4.1

 * move UI static files from ui/ to static/timeside/ (for better django compatibility)
 * upgrade js scripts from telemeta 1.4.4

 * finally fixed an old decoder bug to prevent memory leaks during hard process (thanks to piem)
 * add blocksize property to the processor API
 * add many unit tests (check tests/alltests.py)
 * re-add UI files (sorry, was missing in the last packages)
 * various bugfixes
 * encoders not all much tested on big files, please test!
 * piem is now preparing some aubio analyzers :P

0.3.3
