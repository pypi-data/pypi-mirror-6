    Move autobinding to task base class
    
    The autobinding functionality is more of a
    general task function so it is nice to have it
    available for use in the root base class instead
    of being an auxilary method.

    Refactor task handler binding
    
    Instead of using a dictionary of handler mappings
    use a dict[event] -> list of handler mappings, this
    allows the same function/handler to be bound more than
    once (which can be useful to do, depending on handler
    specifications) and to allow for removal of these handlers
    find the first match and remove it using the reflection
    callback comparison routine.

    reason about then having to determine which states the
    catch-all will allow/be affected by.

    Graph action refactoring
    
    * get rid of dependency counter in graph action:
      analyze graph directly instead when we need to determine nodes we
      need to execute or revert next;
    * move graph interpreting to separate class, GraphAnalyzer:
      instead of inheriting this code from base graph action we now use
      composition;
    * get rid of direct dependency of graph action on engine.

    Ensure that mysql traditional mode is enabled
    
    To avoid *silent* truncation of columns in mysql
    it is much safer to turn on traditional mode which
    behaves in the normal manner.
    
    From the mysql docs:
    
    Make MySQL behave like a "traditional" SQL database system.
    A simple description of this mode is "give an error instead
    of a warning" when inserting an incorrect value into a column.

    Move async utils to own file
    
    Instead of mixing eventlet related utility
    functionality with async utility functionality
    it seems to make sense to seperate those types
    into two different files.

    Refactor engine internals
    
    In this change we:
    - introduce single graph action, that works with futures
    - split methods of TaskAction into schedule/complete parts,
      with schedule* returns future;
    - task executor became entity that manages Executor, instead
      of engine + graph action.

    Storage: use names instead of uuids in interface
    
    Instead of exposing and requiring engines and users to use uuids,
    storage now provides more convenient interface that allows to do
    anything with task by its name.
    
    Storage is now the entity that maintains name-to-uuid mapping. To
    emphasize that, find_by_name method (now unused) was removed from
    FlowDetail.
    
    Breaking change: this will break clients that use storage to manipulate
    tasks. Clients that use engine.storage only to fetch results with
    'fetch' and 'fetch_all' methods (which is the recommended way) are not
    affected.

    Don't reset tasks to PENDING state while reverting
    
    While flow is in REVERTING or REVERTED state, reverted tasks are now
    left in REVERTED state. They are then reset to PENDING state when flow
    is run again. With this change:
    
    - when task is in REVERTED state, its result (if task were
      successfully executed before) is removed, but its failure (if its
      execution or reversion failed) is still available from storage;
    - when flow is in REVERTED or FAILURE states, you can get all task
      failures from storage;
    - if flow is in REVERTED or REVERTING state, but task is in PENDING
      state, it means this task was never executed;
    - flow cannot transition from REVERTED to RUNNING state any more -- it
      should go through PENDING state; on REVERTED -> PENDING transition
      tasks of the flow are reset.
    
    This ensures that failure information is available until it becomes
    irrelevant.

    Be more careful when passing result to revert()
    
    Instead of passing result as separate keyword argument (which may
    lead to strange TypeError exception) we put it to kwargs dict.

    Support for optional task arguments
    
    We used to ignore optional task arguments (arguments of 'execute' method
    with default value). With this change flow author can pass such
    arguments to task by mentioning them in 'requires' and/or 'rebind'
    task constructor parameters.

    Do not erase task progress details
    
    Before this change we used to loose any progress details set by task
    when it was updating its progress when task state was changed from
    RUNNING to SUCCESS (and thus progress forced to 1.0). This commit
    fixes this, so that when progress is updated from the engine latest
    progress details are preserved.
    
    Breaking change: to allow details to be associated with progress
    value they were set for we save progress and then return progress
    value with details.

    Storage: restore injected data on resumption
    
    In storage we now use single task for injector (we look it up by name)
    and we restore result mapping for that task in constructor if there
    is one in flow detail we are given. This has visible effect
    of injected data staying in storage after resumption.

    Helpers to save flow factory in metadata
    
    This change adds new helpers that, taken together, allow to resume
    the flows having nothing but flow detail at hands. First one,
    load_from_factory, gets flow factory function as a parameter and
    saves its fully qualified name and arguments to flow metadata. Others
    can be used to re-create the flow using that metadata, and load
    it into engine.

    Rename get_graph() -> execution_graph
    
    Instead of having a generic get_graph()
    it is nicer to have this function be named
    closer to what it returns (the graph of tasks
    to be executed) as well as make it a property
    since it is more of a property of the engine.

    can work with the same multi-threaded engine.
    
    This executor also works in natively threaded
    applications by correctly altering the future
    condition attribute to use a greened condition,
    which is required to make sure that greenthreads
    run when the condition is waited on.

    Remove decorators and move to utils
    
    In order to avoid the circular import
    in threading utils move the decorators
    functionality to utils/misc and move the
    locking functionality to utils/lock_utils
    and then use these functions from the
    threading util (and elsewhere).

    Reasons are useful for later analysis when running
    as to why the edge between two nodes was created so
    when linking items in the graph it would be nice to
    assign a reason.

    Fix entrypoints being updated/created by update.py
    
    Previously entrypoints were not being created in the
    target projects setup.cfg which means that the target
    project would not be able to correctly use the taskflow
    provided entrypoints. To fix this add a new helper
    function to update.py that alters the entrypoint and
    creates (or updates) the setup.cfg file where those
    entrypoints are defined.

    Simpler API to load flows into engines
    
    Previously to run a flow client code had to put together the flow,
    an engine, logbook, flowdetail, and storage backend. This commit
    adds two helper functions, run() and load(), so that simplest usecase
    now looks like
    
        taskflow.engines.run(flow)
    
    Client code may also provide configuration for storage and engine if
    needed, but if not needed it just works with defaults.
    
    Engines are loaded via stevedore, as drivers in 'taskflow.engines'
    backend. Now three entry points are defined in that namespace:
    - 'default', for SingleThreadedActionEngine, used by default;
    - 'serial', as another synonym for SingleThreadedActionEngine;
    - 'parallel', for MultiThreadedActionEngine.

    Avoid setting object variables
    
    Instead of setting a object state variable, which makes
    a graph_action object now have state we can instead just
    have a new event boolean that will be set to true when
    a suspension is detected. This value will then be used to
    alter the status returned from the parallel graph action.
    
    Also fixes a lack of returned status when there are no
    items to actually run (aka the deps counter dictionary
    is empty).

    Create database from models for SQLite
    
    Alembic does not support SQLite, and we don't recommend to use SQLite

    So we don't bother about working around SQLite limitations, and create

    Remove unused utility classes
    
    Removing ThreadGroupExecutor allows to get rid of threading2
    dependency. LastFedIter is also not used, so there is no
    reason to keep it.

    Remove weakref usage
    
    If a connection escapes the scope of the
    backend object, then python will actually
    garbage collect the backend object even
    though the connection object has a property
    that allows you to fetch the backend. If the
    property is used after the gc occurs a weakref
    failure occurs.
    
    Python is smart enough to correctly deallocate
    these types of object links by itself so lets
    just let it do that.

    Add a flow flattening util
    
    Instead of recursively executing subflows which causes
    dead locks when they parent and subflows share the same
    executor we can instead flatten the parent and subflows
    into a single graph, composed with only tasks and run
    this instead, which will not have the issue of subflows
    dead locking, since after flattening there is no concept
    of a subflow.

    It is now possible to specify what task provides when task class
    (deriving from taskflow.task.Task) is defined, using 'default_provides'
    class attribute or property. This specification may still be overridden
    when task instance is created via 'provides' constructor parameter.

    Verify provides and requires
    
    When flow is being constructed we ensure that it is actually valid by
    checking its invariants:
    - for linear flow, no item should depend on items that are executed
      after it;
    - for unordered flow, items should be independent.
    
    We also add check that all necessary provides were injected to storage
    before actually running flow.

    Instead of having a pretty restrictive module

    more friendly and extensible to move toward a more

    storage backend using stevedore to do the backend
    loading instead of a custom registration/fetching
    mechanism. This allows us to provide a base object
    oriented backend api that can be easily inherited

    Merge "Allow provides to be a set and results to be a dictionary"

commit 8218f57ad2871bc1050dc7e6ecd57af14be0c8c4

Date:   Fri Sep 6 19:03:30 2013 -0700

    Allow provides to be a set and results to be a dictionary
    
    Instead of forcing task provides to be a tuple or list and
    using the corresponding numerical index to determine how to
    interpret the tasks results we should also allow for the task
    provides to be a set and then allow for the tasks result to be
    interpreted as a dictionary.

    Allow engines to be copied + blacklist broken flows
    
    Allow engines to be copied to integrated projects via
    update.py and for the time being blacklist threaded and
    graph flow from being copied (to avoid breakage) until
    the bugs associated with fixing those flows are fixed.
    
    Also a bug was found that would not allow copying over
    the utils module (since a utils.py file no longer
    exists) so ensure that when we encounter a module (and
    not a .py file) we can copy over the correct file that
    belongs to that module (in the case of utils this would
    be the __init__.py of the utils folder).
    
    Also fixes a bug where it appears that due to our usage
    of defaultdict we would copy over more modules than
    desired due to how 'reading' a key in a defaultdict
    actually creates that key using the default value which
    caused these extra module inclusions.

    Add link to why we have to make this factory due to late binding
    
    Since python decorators do not at the time of decoration have
    access to there instance that they are attached to we can't create
    the functor task out of the method at the time of decoration but
    instead we have to create a factory and late bind a functor task
    to the function that was decorated for the function that was wrapped
    to be executed correctly.

    Use the lock decorator and close/join the thread pool
    
    When the thread pool is owned by the engine (when it
    is not passed in) we should be careful and ensure that
    we close the pool (this stops it from accepting new
    work) and then join on the pool (this ensures that all
    contained threads complete) to avoid resource leakage.

    Engine, task, linear_flow unification
    
    In order to move away from the existing flows having their
    own implementation of running, start moving the existing
    flows to be  patterns that only structure tasks (and impose
    constraints about how the group of tasks can run) in useful
    ways.
    
    Let the concept of running those patterns be handled by an
    engine instead of being handled by the flow itself. This
    will allow for varying engines to be able to run flows in
    whichever way the engine chooses (as long as the constraints
    set up by the flow are observed).
    
    Currently threaded flow and graph flow are broken by this
    commit, since they have not been converted to being a
    structure of tasks + constraints. The existing engine has
    not yet been modified to run those structures either, work
    is underway  to remediate this.

    Combine multiple exceptions into a linked one
    
    When multiple tasks running at the same time
    throw exceptions previously we would not be
    able to rethrow all the combined ones which
    was suboptimal. Instead of doing that create
    a combined linked exception that can retain
    all of the exceptions that were thrown and
    rethrow that in the situation where more than
    one task fails.

    State management for engines
    
    All state management moved to storage, including flow (engine) state,
    task states, task results and failures.

    Storage is now implemented using taskflow.persistence and enhanced with

    Action engine: save task results
    
    Task results are saved on success and passed to revert method
    on revert. If task failed (execute method raised an exception),
    special object of type taskflow.utils.misc.Failure is created
    and saved as task result to indicate that.
    
    To store results Storage class is introduced. As for now it is
    simple tiny wrapper of a dictionary, but future plans include
    rewriting it using persistence API and adding more sophisticated
    functionality.

    Initial implementation of action-based engine
    
    This is first in series of changes that provides separation of flows into
    engines and pattens. Patterns define structure, while engine define how
    the task should be run according to said structure.
    
    This change adds the basic patterns and a very simple engine that
    is able to run flow defined with patterns by converting it to recursive
    structure of so-called 'actions'.
    
    For simplicity and ease of review certain major features like
    resumption, saving and passing on task results and notifications are
    left out for farther changes.

    2. Clean the old copy of taskflow (if it exists) before
       placing a new copy in its place, this is very useful
       to avoid stale files.
    3. Move some constants to be offical global constants.
    4. Show exactly what modules are being used from the
       containing projects openstack.common.
    5. Fix how the distributed flow was breaking imports due
       to the location/usage of logbook in that module no
       longer being functionally correct.
    6. Add a header to each file copied/created that tells
       people not to modify them directly.

    Split utils module
    
    In this commit we split utils module into several parts:
    - flow_utils, with code used in running flows;
    - threading_utils, with code that helps in working with threads;
    - reflection, with code that inspects python objects metadata;
    - misc, with all the other code that used to live in utils.py.
    
    We also move graph_utils into taskflow.utils package.
    
    This commit just moves code around. It should not change any logic (with
    exception of complex_graph example).

    Add a locally running threaded flow
    
    Propose a new graph flow that will run every task
    in the graph at the same time but will use a count
    down latch concept to ensure that a tasks dependents
    are provided before the task itself can run. This
    allows for tasks to run in parallel (if they have
    no dependents or are placed in disjoint parts of
    graph).
    
    Note: although this flow uses threads it is typically
    expected that the underlying threads would be greenthreads
    since python native threading is still suboptimal (for
    various reasons).

    Rework the persistence layer
    
    1. Simplify the exposed api to reduce race conditions
       which could occur if we allowed flow details, task
       details and log books to be deleted at different
       times; reduce this down to just being able to save and
       delete from logbooks (and only save/update for flow
       and task details to) to reduce the problem cases.
    2. Introduce a alembic migration with a proper schema so that
       the initial database can be created in the first place,
       adjust its exposed fields and relations to be defined
       by said schema.
    3. Use oslo db models instead of our own.

    Do not have the runner modify the uuid
    
    The uuid is used for result tracking and
    prefixing it with 'r-' makes it hard to
    find that uuid later so leave the uuid
    that is selected as is.

    Refactor decorators
    
    Make decorator code lean and mean by employing FunctorTask to implement
    them. This results in:
    - making everything we call 'task' to provide same interface;
    - encouraging distinction between task classes and task instances;
    - code becoming simpler.

    Nicer way to make task out of any callable
    
    This commit introduces taskflow.functor_task.FunctorTask class, which is
    adapter that can be used to make a task from any callable. Dependencies,
    revert callable, name and version can be specified at the moment of
    construction.

    File movements
    
    In order to rework some of the persistence layer I would
    like to move around some of the files first, keeping job
    specifics in a jobs folder. Having some of the items which
    are root level taskflow items (flow, task) be at the root
    of the hiearchy. Also for now until the celery work is
    commited move that, since it doesn't make sense in backends
    anyway.

    Unify creation/usage of uuids.
    
    Instead of using the name it is likely better to
    give the flows a uuid and use that for tracking
    purposes rather than using the flow name (which

    Use the runner interface as the best task lookup.
    
    Instead of having to examine tasks for requires
    or provides or optional properties/attributes, have
    the runner class do this instead and then have the
    flows which use the runner class just access the known
    to exist attributes directly.

    Move how resuming is done to be disconnected from jobs/flows.
    
    Instead of having resuming tied to a job allow a workflow to
    have a resumption strategy object that will split its initial
    work order into 2 segments. One that has finished previously
    and one that has not finished previously. Refactor the code that
    previously tied a single resumption strategy to the job class
    and move it to a more generic resumption module folder.

    tasks be connected/validated.

    Integrate better locking and a runner helper class.
    
    Ensure that when a linear flow or derivatives is running
    that it can not be modified by another thread at the same
    time it is running by putting a lock around sensitive functions.
    
    Also instead of using the raw task objects themselves
    integrate a helper 'runner' class that provides useful
    functionality that occurs before its tasks runs as well
    as member variables that are associated with the contained
    task.
    
    This helper class currently provides the following:
    
    - A uuid that can be returned to callers of the add
      method to identify there task (and later its results),
      allowing for multiple of the same tasks to be added.
    - Automatic extraction of the needed required and optional
      inputs for the contained task.

    2. Have the graph flow inherit from the linear flow since
    it is performing a linear run using a topological ordering
    of the tasks.

    Don't keep the state/version in the task name.
    
    Instead of having individual entries for the task
    that change with the state name + version, we should
    instead just keep the same task name but update the metadata
    about the states the task has gone through instead. Also
    store the task version in the same metadata and warn users
    when the versions may be incompat.
    
    This makes it easier to see what a task has done
    without having to know all the states it has gone
    through (just to find the task details about that
    task) as well as being able to detect version issues.

    This change allows for that to happen, which involves also
    keeping track of the last task that ran so when resumed via
    soft_reset that task can be the one started off from (instead
    of starting from the start of all tasks).
