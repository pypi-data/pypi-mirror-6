Description: 
              Simple Python implementation of the Git file formats and
              protocols.
        
              All functionality is available in pure Python. Optional
              C extensions can be built for improved performance.
        
              Dulwich takes its name from the area in London where the friendly
              Mr. and Mrs. Git once attended a cocktail party.
