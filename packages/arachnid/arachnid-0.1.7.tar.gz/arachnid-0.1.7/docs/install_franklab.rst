	If you have a license file on one computer, then just copy it to another.
	
	$ scp -r ~/.continuum 156.111.X.XXX:~/

**Troubleshooting**

If the installation gives the following error:

.. sourcecode:: sh
	
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "/home/liaoh/anaconda/bin/conda", line 3, in <module>
	from conda.cli import main

Then added $PWD/anaconda/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
