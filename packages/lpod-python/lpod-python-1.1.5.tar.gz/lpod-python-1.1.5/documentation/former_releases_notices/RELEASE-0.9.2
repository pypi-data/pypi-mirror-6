==========
LpOD 0.9.2
==========

lpOD -- languages & platforms OpenDocument.
Definition of a Free Software API implementing the ISO/IEC 26300 standard.
Development, for higher level use cases, in Python, Perl and Ruby languages.
of a top-down oriented API.

This release adds preliminary support for the manifest, and scripts CLI is
more homogeneous. A new script lpod-convert converts documents from one format
to another (currently ods to odt, and reStructuredText to odt). The scripts
lpod-rst2odt was dropped as it's now a duplicate of lpod-convert.

Low-level API
=============

- The XML API in the odf_element class has seen many name shortenings:

    Before          After
    --------------  -------
    get_tagname     get_tag
    set_tagname     set_tag
    insert_element  insert
    append_element  append
    delete_element  delete

- "odf_element.delete" now accepts no argument to delete itself as a
  shortcut.

- "odf_create_element" accepts qualified names such as "text:p" to quickly
  create a single element.

- "get/set_boolean_attribute" as shortcuts to get/set a "true"/"false"
  attribute from a boolean ("true" and "false" accepted too).

- The undocumented and unspecified VFS was dropped (and so the pygobject
  dependency). The Python Standard Library, third-party packages and library
  wrappers offer enough file and file-like objects with "read" and "write"
  methods for your needs.

High-level API
==============

- Methods "get_heading_*" now get an "outline_level" argument instead of
  "level" for consistency and not to mix with attribute "text:level"

- Most scripts now write to the standard output, and provide "-o" option.
  Exceptions are lpod-highlight (in-place) and lpod-mm2odt (foo.mm ->
  foo.odt).

- lpod-merge now merges documents in the first document provided, so this one
  provides the styles.

- Methods "get_<element>_by_yyy" are merged in a single "get_<element>" and
  several optional arguments.

- Some variable methods were renamed for consistency:

    Before               After
    -------------------  ------------------------
    get_variable_list    get_variable_decl_list
    get_variable_sets    get_variable_set_list
    (missing)            get_variable_set
    get_variable_value   get_variable_set_value
    get_user_field_list  get_user_field_decl_list

- Method "get_tracked_changes" was moved from odf_content to odf_element,
  to group it with all other tracked changes methods.
