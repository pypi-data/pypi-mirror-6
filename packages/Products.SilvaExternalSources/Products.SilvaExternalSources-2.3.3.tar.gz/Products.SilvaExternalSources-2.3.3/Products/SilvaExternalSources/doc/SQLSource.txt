SilvaExternalSource - Silva SQL Source

  The "Silva SQL Source" is a replacement for the older "Silva SQL Data
  Source" asset and "external data" Document element. 

  Essentially it wraps the functionality of a "Z SQL Method" where the
  resultset of querying the RDBMS is rendered as a table into a Silva
  Document.

  Adding:

    When adding a new Silva SQL Source one needs to provide for an id and a
    title. This alone is not enough for having a functioning SQL Source. It
    then needs more editing.

  Editing:

    There are three important parts of a Code Source that need editing:

    1) Basic settings:

      Title, connection id, data encoding, SQL statement, description, 
      Layout object id, cacheable setting, reset layout rendering, reset
      parameters form...

    2) Parameters:

      Formulator form...

    3) Contents:

      Data rendering scripts and templates are put here...
