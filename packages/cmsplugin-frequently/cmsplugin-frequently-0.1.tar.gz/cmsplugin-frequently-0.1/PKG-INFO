Description: CMSPlugin Frequently
        ====================
        
        django-cms plugin and apphook for the django-frequently app.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To get the latest stable release from PyPi
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install cmsplugin-frequently
        
        To get the latest commit from GitHub
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install -e git+git://github.com/bitmazk/cmsplugin-frequently.git#egg=cmsplugin_frequently
        
        TODO: Describe further installation steps (edit / remove the examples below):
        
        Add ``cmsplugin_frequently`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...,
                'cmsplugin_frequently',
            )
        
        If you are a new user, migrate your database. If you used django-frequently<2.0
        before, skip this step and follow the steps below.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            ./manage.py migrate cmsplugin_frequently
        
        Migration from django-frequently < 1.0
        --------------------------------------
        
        This app was actually a part of
        `django-frequently <https://github.com/bitmazk/django-frequently>`_. At some
        point we had to get rid of django-cms dependencies in that app, so we carved
        out all django-cms relevant parts and put them into this cmsplugin app.
        
        If you were using django-frequently<1.0 please make sure that you follow these
        instructions very closely:
        
        1. Update to django-frequently<1.0 and run the migrations to make sure that
           your DB is at the latest version of the old frequently app
        2. Update the django-frequently to the latest version and install
           cmsplugin-frequently like described above
        3. Add ``cmsplugin_frequently`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
        4. Run the first migration via ``./manage.py migrate cmsplugin_frequently 0001 --delete-ghost-migrations``
        5. Migrate your old plugins to this new app via ``./manage.py migrate_to_frequently_v1``
        
        Step 5 deletes your migrations for django-frequently from
        ``south_migrationhistory`` because for version 1 we have reset the South
        mirations. To get back to the latest migration, do the following::
        
          ./manage.py migrate frequently 0001 --fake
          ./manage.py migrate frequently
          ./manage.py migrate cmsplugin_frequently
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Just login to the Pages admin and place the plugin whereever you would like to
        render a cateogry of the frequently app.
        
        IMPORTANT: Make sure to include the js file in the cms template::
        
            <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}frequently/js/frequently.js"></script>
