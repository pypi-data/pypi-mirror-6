Description: CPU Cooler Chart
        ================
        
        CPU Cooler Chart (CCC) is CPU cooler performance and price database.
        It merges data from CPU cooler performance measurements and price information
        from Coolenjoy and Danawa.
        
        CPU Cooler Chart is comprised of two parts, the API server part (this project)
        and the web client part. You can find the web part at
        `github.com/clee704/cpucoolerchart-web`_.
        
        .. _github.com/clee704/cpucoolerchart-web: https://github.com/clee704/cpucoolerchart-web
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        CPU Cooler Chart depends on lxml_. You need to install liblxml2
        and libxslt to install lxml. For more information, see `Installing lxml`_.
        
        If you are ready to install lxml, you can install CPU Cooler Chart. There are
        many ways to do that but using pip is recommended:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install --pre cpucoolerchart
        
        Currently ``--pre`` argument is needed but it will be unnecessary once a
        non-developmental release is out.
        
        .. _lxml: http://lxml.de
        .. _Installing lxml: http://lxml.de/installation.html
        
        
        Running
        -------
        
        Before running the web server, you must initialize a database:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ cpucoolerchart createdb
        
        It will make a SQLite database at ``instance/development.db`` under the current
        directory. Although not tested, there is no restrictions on the choice of
        the database to use as long as SQLAlchemy_ supports it. See Config_ for how to
        change database options.
        
        Now the database is ready and empty. Run the following command to fill it with
        data:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ cpucoolerchart update
        
        It will fetch measurement data from Coolenjoy_. It might spit out some
        warnings due to inconsistencies in the data or because you haven't provided
        Danawa_ API keys. Nothing is a serious problem for now.
        
        To see the data, first you need to run a web server:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ cpucoolerchart runserver
        
        It will run a development server at port 5000. Open your browser and go to
        ``http://localhost:5000/makers``. It should show some heatsink makers in JSON
        format. Go to ``http://localhost:5000/all`` to download a CSV file that
        contains all data. For the complete list of HTTP APIs, see `the docs`__.
        Meanwhile, you can read `views.py`_ file for what's there.
        
        For production, there are `many options`_ to run a web server (you should not
        use the development server in production). CPU Cooler Chart is built with
        Flask_, which means it's WSGI-compatible. The endpoint is
        ``cpucoolerchart.wsgi:app``. Or you can make a custom Python file and create an
        app there:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from cpucoolerchart.app import create_app
            app = create_app({
                'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI': 'postgres://user:pass@somewhere:5432/ccc'
            })
