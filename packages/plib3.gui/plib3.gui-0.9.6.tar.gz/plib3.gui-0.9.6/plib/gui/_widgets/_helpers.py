Defines "helper" classes that implement the basic functionality
to make widgets look like Python containers. The two basic
container structures supported are:

- A "row" structure: the top-level container is a sequence of rows,
  and each row is in turn a sequence of columns. The top-level
  container is fully mutable (new rows can be inserted/appended,
  and existing rows can be deleted), but each row is of fixed length
  (columns cannot be added or deleted).

- A "tree" structure: the top-level container is a mutable list of items,
  where each item is a 2-sequence: the first member is a fixed-length
  sequence of columns, and the second member is a list of sub-items,
  which has the same structure recursively.
