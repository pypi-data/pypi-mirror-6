External Library Geodesic

Original library (published under MIT license):
http://code.google.com/p/geodesic/

We added a python wrapped and made small fixes to the original library, to make it compatible with cython.

To install this, run "python setup.py install" in current folder.
Python 2.7, Cython, and other python libraries are required to be installed previously by you.
