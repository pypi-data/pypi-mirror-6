        Overview
        --------
        Googkit is an easy way to use Google Closure Library.
        You can setup only two commands, so start developing quickly.
        You can also do such a complicated compiling ... at one blow!
        
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Googkit requires Following commands.
        Install them if not installed yet.
        
        :Git:    downloads Closure Library
        :Python: executes Closure Tools
        
        
        
        
        Install Googkit
        ---------------
        First, you need to install Googkit.
        
        
        Linux or OS X
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. Download and extract `the latest version of Googkit <https://github.com/googkit/googkit/releases>`_
        
        
        2. Put it into a preferred place::
        
             $ mv googkit /usr/local
        
        
        3. Add environment variables::
        
             export GOOGKIT_HOME=/usr/local/googkit
             export PATH=$PATH:$GOOGKIT_HOME/bin
        
        
        Windows

        1. Download and extract `the latest version of Googkit <https://github.com/googkit/googkit/releases>`_
        
        
        2. Put it into a preferred place::
        
             $ move googkit C:\
        
        
        3. Add environment variables
        
           +------------------+--------------------------------+
           | Variable         | Value                          |
           +==================+================================+
           | ``GOOGKIT_HOME`` | ``C:\googkit``                 |
           | ``PATH``         | Append ``;%GOOGKIT_HOME%\bin`` |
           +------------------+--------------------------------+
        
        
        
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        1. Create a project directory and initialize::
        
             $ mkdir my_project
             $ cd my_project
             $ googkit init
        
        
        2. Download Closure Tools::
        
             $ googkit setup
        
        
        3. Develop your web app in ``development/``
        
           Modify existing scripts, or add your awesome scripts
           to ``development/js_dev``.
        
           After adding/removing scripts, you need to update dependency information::
        
             $ googkit ready
        
        
        4. Build your project
        
           Building the project including JavaScript files compilation improves
           performance and makes them unreadable::
        
             $ googkit build
        
           If it succeed, output files will be stored in ``production/``.
        
        
        
        
        Project Structure
        -----------------
        :googkit.cfg:  config file of the project
        :closure/:     stores Closure Tools
        :development/: for development
        :debug/:       for debug (it will be created if debug is enabled)
        :production/:  for production
        
        
        
        
        Running Unit Tests
        ------------------
        You can run `jsunit-style <http://people.apache.org/~dennisbyrne/infoq/js_tdd.2.htm>`_
        unit tests.
        
        
        1. Create a HTML file for testing
        
           Copy `example_test.html <https://github.com/googkit/googkit/blob/master/template/development/js_dev/example_test.html>`_
           into the same directory as the target, then rename it to
           ``{target_name}_test.html``.
        
           If you don't like the default name ``{target_name}_test.html``, you can
           change it by ``test_file_pattern`` in ``googkit.cfg``.
        
        
        2. Write unit tests
        
        
        3. Apply config changes and update dependency information::
        
             $ googkit ready
        
        
        4. Run unit tests
        
           Open the test html file in your browser.
        
           If you want to run all tests, open ``development/all_tests.html``
           in your browser with **http scheme** (doesn't work with file scheme).
        
        
        
        
        Tips
        ----
        
        
        Renaming a Compiled Script
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Edit ``compiled_js`` in ``googkit.cfg``.
        After editing, apply it with a following command::
        
          $ googkit ready
        
        
        Preventing Some Scripts from Compiling
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Place them outside ``development/js_dev``.
        Scripts that are in it will be compiled and removed in production.
        
        
        Debugging a Compiled Source
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Change ``is_debug_enabled`` to ``yes`` in ``googkit.cfg`` and build it::
        
          $ googkit build
        
        Then you can use debugging features in ``debug/``.
        This option makes compilation slow.
        
        
        Using Source Map
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Googkit generates a source map file ``script.min.js.map`` within ``debug/``,
        so you can use `Source Map V3 <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit?pli=1>`_
        if your browser supports it.
        
        For reason of obfuscation, source map file will **NOT** be stored
        in ``production/``.
