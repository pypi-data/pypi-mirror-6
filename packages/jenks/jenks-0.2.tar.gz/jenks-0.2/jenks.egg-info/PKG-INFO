        =====
        
        A Jenkins command-line tool.
        
        * since jenkinsapi (one of the dependencies) is only python2 compatible, jenks is currently only python2 compatible.

        Using
        -----
        
        jenks looks for a .jenksrc file, recursively going up from the current working directory you're in.
        
        Most users are probably ok with just adding a .jenksrc to their user root.
        
        Example .jenksrc::
        
            localhost: 
              url: 'http://localhost:8080/'
              jobs:
                - foo
                - bar
