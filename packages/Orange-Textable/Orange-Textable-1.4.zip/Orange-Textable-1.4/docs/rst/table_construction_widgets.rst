Table construction widgets
==========================

Widgets of this category take *Segmentation* data in input and emit *Table*
data. They are thus ultimately responsible for converting text to tables,
either by counting items (:ref:`Count`), by measuring their length
(:ref:`Length`), by quantifying their diversity (:ref:`Variety`), or by
exploiting the annotations associated with them
(:ref:`Annotation`). Finally, widget :ref:`Context` makes it possible to build
concordances and collocation lists.
