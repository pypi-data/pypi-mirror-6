        PHASESHIFTS PACKAGE
        ===================
        
        This package is a Python-based implementation of the  Barbieri/Van Hove 
        phase shift (*phsh*) calculation package needed to produce phase shifts for 
        various LEED packages (including CLEED), as well as for certain XPD packages. 
        To quote the original authors site: 
        
        "The phase shift calculation is performed in several steps:
        
        1. Calculation of the radial charge density for a free atom.
        
        2. Calculation of the radial muffin-tin potential for atoms embedded in a 
           surface defined by the user (the surface is represented by a slab that 
           is periodically repeated in 3 dimensions, within vacuum between the 
           repeated slabs); various approximations to the exchange potential 
           are available; relativistic effects are taken into account.
        
        3. Calculation of phase shifts from the muffin-tin potential.
        
        4. Elimination of pi-jumps in the energy dependence of the phase shifts."
        
        .. note:: You can get the original Fortran source (& learn more about the *phsh* programs) from:

        Install
        =======
        
        The `phaseshifts` package requires CPython 2.6 or later and also uses the
        `numpy`, `scipy` and `periodictable` packages. Unfortunately, it has only
        been tested extensively with Python 2.7, so your milage may vary. To perform
        a setup follow the steps below.
        
         1. Install the numpy, scipy and periodictable packages. 
            
            On systems with PyPI this can be done using the command:
        	
            .. code:: bash
                 
        		pip install numpy scipy periodictable
        
            Or if you have the easy_install package:
            
            .. code:: bash
                 
        		 easy_install install numpy scipy periodictable
        
            Alternatively download and install these packages manually following the
            instructions provided for the respective packages.
        
         2. To install the phaseshifts package:
        
            .. code:: bash
                 
        		python setup.py install  
        
            With any luck the package has been installed successfully. A set of test scripts
            are provided, however a simple check may suffice using an interactive session of 
            the python interpreter:
        
              >>> import phaseshifts
              >>> from phaseshifts import libphsh  # compiled FORTRAN .pyd or .so using f2py
        
            If these execute without errors then it is likely that all is well, but in case of 
            problems or bugs please use the contact provided below and I will do my best to 
            address the problem quickly.
            
            .. note:: If you encounter problems when building under windows using the MSCV 
                      compiler then try the following:
                      
                      .. code:: bash
                           
                         python setup.py config --compiler=mingw32 build --compiler=mingw32 install
                      
                      If you continue to experience problems you may need to install the appropriate
                      MSVC for your installation (e.g. Visual C++ 2008 Express for Python 2.7).
                    
        
        .. tip:: On Windows systems it may be easier to install a scientific python distibution 
                 rather than install the dependencies from source - I use Python(x,y) with mingw 
                 (gcc & gfortran) installed, which can be found at:
        		 
                 http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy
        
        
        About the code
        ==============
        
        The example source codes provided in this package are intended to be 
        instructional in calculating phase shifts. While it is not recommended to 
        use the example code in production, the code
        should be sufficient to explain the general use of the library.
        
        If you aren't familiar with the phase shift calculation process, you can 
        read further information in ``doc/`` folder:
        
        + ``phshift2007.rst`` - a brief user guide/documentation concerning the input files 
          (& details of the original fortran `phshift` package).
        + ``manual.pdf``      - a more detailed overview of the library functions and how to
          calculate phase shifts using the convenience functions in this package. This is not
          yet finished and so the reader is referred to the above document for the time being.
        
        For those wanting a crash course I advise reading the phsh2007.txt document.
        See the ``examples/`` directory to get an idea of the structure of the input files 
        (for a random selection of models & elements). In particular see the ``cluster_Ni.i``
        file for helpful comments regarding each line of input.
        
        Those of you who are eager to generate phase shifts - first look at the example
        cluster files for a bulk and slab calculation, noting that the atoms in the model
        are in fractional (SPA) units of the unitcell. Next, after creating a bulk and 
        slab model in the ``cluster.i`` format, simply use the following python code:
         
           >>> import phaseshifts as phsh
           >>> phsh.phaseshifts.gen_from_inputs(bulk='cluster_bulk.i', slab='cluster_slab.i')
        
        This will hopefully produce the desired phase shift output files (at least for 
        simple models) and works by assessing the two models to determine what output to
        produce. For more detailed documentation and function use refer to the pdf manual.

        This package is developed/maintained in my spare time so any bug reports, patches, 
        or other feedback are very welcome and should be sent to: liam.m.deacon@gmail.com
        
        The project is in the early developmental stages and so anyone who wishes to get

        Todo
        ====
        
         1. Full implementation of python convenience functions and classes to easily 
            generate phase shift output files.
        
         2. Documentation - the manual has not yet been started and so is a high priority
            after No. 1. The current aim is to use sphinx to generate html and latex documents
            for semi-automated generation of both the tutorial and supporting website.  
        
         3. Test suit to verify the package is working as expected.
        
         4. GUI frontend (Qt ui files are provided in the ``gui/`` directory for anyone 
            wishing to undertake this challenge). Other frontends are welcome (I use Qt 
            due to familiarity/experience). For those wishing a sneak preview, try executing
            ``main.pyw``
        
        See TODO.rst for more information.
