What is PyBan?
--------------
PyBan is a command line application for managing Kanban boards.

Where is everything saved?
--------------------------
At the moment, data is pickled and saved into the .pyban folder in the folder
where you ran pyban. Sort of git-style, because I like that.

How do I use PyBan?
-------------------
Install it. Run pyban in your project directory. A ".pyban" directory will be
created in the folder where you ran pyban. You should be greeted by the prject
screen. Enter som info about your project and, most importantly, add a board
(your project can have several boards). Press Q to leave the project screen.
Here you can select the board heading, the column headings, or individual tasks.
Once selected you can enter their settings screen to do stuff like renaming,
adding columns or setting a column's task limit. In the board screen you can
add tasks to your currently selected column.

From here it should be fairly obvious how to use PyBan as long as you have
some basic knowledge about Kanban. If you don't know how Kanban works - 
look it up on Wikipedia.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board might be a good place to start.
