PyMediaFire
===========

This module provides a subset of MediaFire's REST API.
Only the basic stuff is done : upload, download, create folder, read folder.

If you have questions, patches, etc. feel free to contact the author directly at schampailler at skynet dot be.


Example
-------

Let's look at a simple session::

 from pymediafire import MediaFireSession

 # Open a session with your credential (check MediaFire's developper page
 # for all the information)
 mf = MediaFireSession('youremail@gonzo.be', 'password', '123123',
                       '7kjshfksjdhf435lkj435345kj')

 # Load the root folder (no parameter == root folder)
 f = mf.load_folder()

 # The following print will give a list of pymediafire objects representing
 # files and folders on the server.
 print(f)

 # [FILE: dbcr.txt 198 bytes 2013-12-04 14:41:56 ma32h6y9fkmdmub,
 # FOLDER: backup_folder q3w4bx45i432c]

 # Download the first file of the loaded folder 

 mf.download(f[0], f[0].filename)
