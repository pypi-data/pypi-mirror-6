pyoauth2 Provider Documentation
===============================

This library currently implements a very small subset of the OAuth 2.0 draft specification. Supported sections include:

* Authorization Code Grant flow as defined by http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-31#section-4.1
* Bearer token type defined by http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-22

Support for the full OAuth 2.0 specification is planned as a long-term goal.
