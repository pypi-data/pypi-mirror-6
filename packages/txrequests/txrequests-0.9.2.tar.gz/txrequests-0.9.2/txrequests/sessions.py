txrequests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides a small add-on for the requests http library. It makes use
of twisted threadpool.

    from txrequests import Session

    session = Session()
    # request is run in the background
    d = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get')
    # ... do other stuff ...
    # wait for the request to complete, if it hasn't already
    @d.addCallback
    def print_res(response):
        print('response status: {0}'.format(response.status_code))
        print(response.content)
