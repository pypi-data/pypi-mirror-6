Introduction
==============

**lpOD** -- languages & platforms OpenDocument,
is a Free Software project that offers, for high level use cases, an application programming interface dedicated to document processing with the `Python`, `Perl` and `Ruby` languages. It's complying with the `Open Document Format` (ODF), i.e. the
`ISO/IEC 26300` international standard.

lpOD is designed according to a **top-down** approach. The API is bound to the document
functional structure and the user's point of view [1]_. As a consequence, it may be used without knowledge of the ODF specification, and
allows the application developer to be focused on the business needs instead of the low level storage concerns.

This documentation describes the lpod-python implementation. For more informations, see the global lpod-project documentation.



.. [1] At the opposite of implementations based on a code generation from the ODF RelaxNG schema.
