Pywizard
**************************************

Pywizard is a lightweight python library for configuration management.

It can be used as part of any software, that need to manage system resources, like users, installed packages,
running services, firewall ports ... etc.

As well you can use it as standalone tool with nice DSL (python itself),
even if you are not too familiar with one of the most powerful scripting languages in the world.
