Description: Some software requires the ability to take input data from a network socket,
        act on that data, and the send it on to a remote host (possibly in a modified
        state). The Trixy module allows that to be done through a simple interface.
        Simply create a trixy server with a handler that does what is desired. Here is
        an example that tunnels unmodified data to a remote host:
        
          #! /usr/bin/env python3
          import asyncore
          import trixy
          
          
          class TrixyTunnel(trixy.SimpleTunnel):
              def initiate(self):
                  # Determine which host to connect to
                  self.remote(('austinhartzheim.me', 80))  # Tunnel to this web server
        
          # Run the tunnel from a port on localhost
          server = trixy.TrixyProxyServer(TrixyTunnel, 'localhost', 80)
          asyncore.loop()
