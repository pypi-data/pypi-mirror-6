Django SQL Explorer
===================

Django SQL Explorer is inspired by Stack Exchange's [Data Explorer](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/queries) and is designed to make the flow of data between people in your company fast, simple, and confusion-free. Quickly write and share SQL queries in a clean, usable query builder, preview the results in the browser, share links to download CSV files, and keep the information flowing baby!

django-sql-explorer is MIT licensed, and pull requests are welcome!

Features
========

- **Safety & Security**
    - Admins-only. Nice try randos! You have to pass the is_staff() test to access explorer.
    - No destructive queries. Enforces a SQL blacklist so destructive queries don't get executed (delete, drop, update etc). This is not bulletproof and it's recommended that you instead configure a read-only database role, but when not possible the blacklist provides reasonable protection.
- **Easy to get started**
    - 100% built on Django's ORM, so works with Postgresql, Mysql, and Sqlite.
    - Zero dependencies other than Django and front-end libraries. More detail below.
    - Just want to get in and write some ad-hoc queries? Go nuts with the Playground area.
- **Looks Reasonably Not Crappy**
    - Thanks to CodeMirror and Bootstrap you might actually enjoy this for querying more than pgadmin or phpmyadmin
- **Parameterized Queries**
    - Use $$foo$$ in your queries and Explorer will build a UI to fill out parameters. When viewing a query like 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE id=$$id$$', Explorer will generate UI for the 'id' parameter.
    - Parameters are stashed in the URL, so you can share links to parameterized queries with colleagues
- **Schema Helper**
    - /explorer/schema/ renders a list of your Django apps' table and column names that you can refer to while writing queries. Apps are excludable from this list so users aren't bogged down in tons of irrelevant tables.
    - Note there is an open issue that the schema explorer does not show join tables for m2m relations. It's a work in progres...
- **Django Admin Support**
    - Download multiple queries at once as a zip file through Django's admin interface via a built-in admin action.
- **Meaningful Test Coverage**
    - You can even run them yourself! Just install factory_boy and run "manage.py test"

Install
=======

Requires Python 2.7.

This has been tested only with Django 1.6, however it should work back to 1.4. Please report an issue if you encounter problems on earlier versions of Django.

Install with pip from github:

``pip install django-sql-explorer``

Add to your installed_apps:

``INSTALLED_APPS = (
...,
'explorer',
...
)``

Add the following to your urls.py (all Explorer URLs are restricted to staff only):

``url(r'^explorer/', include('explorer.urls')),``

Run syncdb to create the tables (well...just one table really):

``python manage.py syncdb``

Browse to https://yoursite/explorer/ and get exploring!


Dependencies
============

An effort has been made to require no packages other than Django. However a number of front-end dependencies do exist and are documented below. All front-end dependencies are served from CDNJS.com

Settings

Setting                      Description                                                                                                                                     Default
============================ =============================================================================================================================================== ================================================================================================================
EXPLORER_SQL_BLACKLIST       Disallowed words in SQL queries to prevent destructive actions.                                                                                 ('ALTER', 'RENAME ', 'DROP', 'TRUNCATE', 'INSERT INTO', 'UPDATE', 'REPLACE', 'DELETE')
EXPLORER_SQL_WHITELIST       These phrases are allowed, even though part of the phrase appears in the blacklist.                                                             ('DROP FUNCTION', 'REPLACE FUNCTION', 'DROP VIEW', 'REPLACE VIEW', 'CREATED', 'DELETED')
EXPLORER_DEFAULT_ROWS        The number of rows to show by default in the preview pane.                                                                                      100
EXPLORER_SCHEMA_EXCLUDE_APPS Don't show schema for these apps in /schema/. This is helpful to clear out cruft that users realistically won't want to refer to for reference. ('',)  # No apps are excluded
