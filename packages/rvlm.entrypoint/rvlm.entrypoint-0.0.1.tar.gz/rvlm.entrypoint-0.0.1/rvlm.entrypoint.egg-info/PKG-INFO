Description: rvlm.entrypoint
        ---------------
        
        Converts function's arguments to getopt-style command line options and
        arguments. This may definitely help in writing small and clear scripts, with
        no ugly command line parsing code.
        
        This module can:
        
        * Automatically generate argument parsers basing on "main" function signature
          and docstring.
        * Automatically run the "main" function when a script is called directly,
          but not when it is included as a module.
        
        Right after this module was written, its author discovered for himself
        the `entrypoint` module (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/entrypoint). But it
        appeared to be that original `entrypoint` behaves sometimes in a strange
        way. So, it was decided to continue development, and also to rename this module
        to `rvlm.entrypoint` from former `rvlm.argmap`, becase this name
        sounds better still doesn't introduce names conflict by having a prefix.
