#summary What to read about Dependency Injection

Wikipedia, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection Dependency Injection]
  The article is not great and a bit messy, but it can be a starting point.

Martin Fowler, [http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern]
  Good article (as almost all Martin's) with detailed explanations. It might seem a bit outdated after Guice launched.

Guice [http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=google-guice&s=google-guice&t=UsersGuide User's Guide]
  Guice is a Java dependency injection from Google. Its guide is definitely worth reading, even if you don't use Java.

[http://www.picocontainer.org/ PicoContainer's] site
  Provides a lot of information about DI and has the most complete description of DI types in Java.


Dhanji R. Prasanna, [http://www.manning.com/prasanna/ Dependency Injection]
  This book is a must to read, if you really want to understand DI. It covers both Guice and Spring.
