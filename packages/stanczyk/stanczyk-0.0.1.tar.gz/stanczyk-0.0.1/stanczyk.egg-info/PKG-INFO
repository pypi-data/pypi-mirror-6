        Name and spelling
        =================
        
        ``stanczyk`` is named after `Stańczyk`_, a historical Polish jester.
        Other Crypto 101 projects (such as merlyn_, arthur_ and clarent_) were
        already named after things from the court of Arthurian legend; I
        picked Stańczyk because:
        
        1. Poland is awesome.
        2. This project looks simple, but it's actually pretty clever; perhaps
           more than its peers.
        3. Poland is awesome.
        
        The banner is an excerpt from the famous painting of Stańczyk by `Jan
        Matejko`_.
