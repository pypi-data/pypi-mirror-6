buildprof
=========

Introduction
------------

buildprof is a tool that can generate and view build profiles.
It parses the output of the standard command 'top -b', and the statistics files
generated by ccache > 3.0.

It generates a chart with the cpu, memory usage and ccache hit/miss rate over time.

By passing the mouse cursor over the graph, you can see the process that were running at
that time on the machine, and see what's going on when the cpu is not 100% utilised.

Installation
------------

buildprof uses the standard python library and has no other dependancies.
It embeds an angularjs + nvd3 html5 application, to view the results.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip install buildprof

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    buildprof make -j4

This will run your make -j4, and then open a browser with the results.
The results are stored in a file named ``<hostname>.html`, you can customize it via ``--output_file``

.. code-block:: bash

    buildprof `hostname`.html

Use this to open a previously created file.
