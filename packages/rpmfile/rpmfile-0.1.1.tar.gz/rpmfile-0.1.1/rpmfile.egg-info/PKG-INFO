        ========
        
        Tools for inspecting RPM files in python. This module is modeled after the tarfile module.
        
        ## Example 
        
            import rpmfile
            
            with rpmfile.open('file.rpm') as rpm:
            
                #Inspect the RPM headers
                print rpm.headers.keys()
                print rpm.headers.get('arch', 'noarch')
                
                #Extract a fileobject from the archive
                fd = rpm.extractfile('./usr/bin/script')
                print fd.read() 
                
                for member in rpm.getmembers():
                    print member
                
        
        ## Classes
            
            * rpmfile.RPMFile: The RPMFile object provides an interface to a RPM archive
            * rpmfile.RPMInfo: An RPMInfo object represents one member in a RPMFile.
