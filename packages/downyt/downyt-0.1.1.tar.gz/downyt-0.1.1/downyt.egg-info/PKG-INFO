        downyt - Downloading from YouTube
        =================================
        
        **This project is deprecated!** This little tool was written to fill a void
        that turned out it wasn't there. After I found *youtube-dl* I can only
        recommend it for completeness and robustness:

        Introduction
        ------------
        
        *downyt* is a simple commandline tool to make youtube videos available for
        offline watching. It takes a youtube video URL or even just the video ID and
        download it to your local storage. That's it! Nothing more, nothing less. It
        might not change your life but it'll probably take the spinner out of your
        underground commute...
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        *downyt* is primarily implemented in Python 3.3. I'm planning on making it work
        with Python 2.7 as well but it is currently untested and might now work. All
        instructions assume that you have Python 3.3 setup.
        
        It's simple, just get it from PyPI::
        
            pip install downyt
        
        or install the latest version from github::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-fancypages.git
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You can download a video from YouTube by providing it's URL or video ID. An
        example would be::
        
            downyt http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1coLC-MUCJc
        
        or::
        
            downyt '1coLC-MUCJc'
        
        Both command will download the video into the current directory in the ``MP4``
        format. Alternatively, you can specify the output format and directory like
        this::
        
            downyt '1coLC-MUCJc' -t webm -o ~/Downloads
        
        In addition, you can define the default download directory in a config file in
        your home directory. Put the following in ``$HOME/.downyt/config.yml`` and it
        will be used if no output directory is specified::
        
            output_dir: /home/username/Downloads
        
        That's all there is to know.
