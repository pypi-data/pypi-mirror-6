objbrowser
==========

Python object browser implemented in Qt.

Shows an object in a tree view so that you can examine its attributes
recursively (e.g. browse through a list of dictionaries).

From the _View_ menu you can select some extra columns, for instance the 
'object ID' column.

The details pane at the bottom shows object properties that do not fit
on one line, such as the docstrings and the output of various functions 
of the 'inspect' module from the Python standard library.
