        Oct2Py is a means to seamlessly call M-files and Octave functions from Python.
        It manages the Octave session for you, sharing data behind the scenes using
        MAT files.  Usage is as simple as:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> oc = oct2py.Oct2Py() 
            >>> x = oc.zeros(3,3)
            >>> print x, x.dtype
            [[ 0.  0.  0.]
             [ 0.  0.  0.]
             [ 0.  0.  0.]] float64
            ...
        
        If you want to run legacy m-files, do not have MATLAB(TM), and do not fully
        trust a code translator, this is your library.  
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Supports all Octave datatypes and most Python datatypes and Numpy dtypes.
        - Provides OctaveMagic_ for IPython, including inline plotting in notebooks.
        - Supports cell arrays and structs with arbitrary nesting.
        - Supports sparse matrices.
        - Builds methods on the fly linked to Octave commands (e.g. `zeros` above).
        - Nargout is automatically inferred by the number of return variables.
        - Thread-safety: each Oct2Py object uses an independent Octave session.
        - Can be used as a context manager.
        - Supports Unicode characters.

        Installation
        ------------
        You must have GNU Octave installed and in your PATH. On Windows, the easiest
        way to get Octave is to use an installer from `Sourceforge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20Windows%20binaries/>`_.
        On Linux, it should be available from your package manager.
        Additionally, you must have the Numpy and Scipy libraries installed.
        
        To install Oct2Py, simply:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install oct2py
        
        Or, if you absolutely must:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ easy_install oct2py
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Documentation is available online_.
