    Implements a "locking" version of ``shutil.copy()``.

    This function exists to provide a more atomic method for copying a file
    into a Linux folder which is being watched by a file monitor running on the
    Linux machine.  This is necessary because it is not practical to watch for
    any particular ``pyinotify`` event in order to know when the file is "free"
    - at least in the case of a simple copy.  The reason for this is that
    ``shutil.copy()`` first copies the file, but then will attempt to change
    its attributes.  Under normal circumstances it would seem best to respond
    to the "create" (or "write close") event on the file, but in this case the
    attribute update really must occur before the watched file is processed.
