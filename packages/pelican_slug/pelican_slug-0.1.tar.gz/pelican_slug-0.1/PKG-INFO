Description: Pelican Slug Pugin
        ==================
        
        Pelican is good project but slugify function is a little bit unuseful and not customizable.
        This problem will appear if you are a developer using multi-byte language.
        So we wanna exchange multi-byte words to alphabetical words caused by multi-byte url problem.
        
        URL encoded word is not beautiful, Japanese word Otaku will change like this "%83I%83%5E%83N".
        If we can use an URL containing only alphabets and other marks not multi-byte, we wanna do that.
        
        Pelican try to automatically exchange it. But Japanese and some multi-byte languages are very complex
        that because they are having some pronounciations. This try will absolutely be failure and they make
        funny words we could not read it.
        
        This plugin will help these situation. You can define some slugs for your categories like this::
        
            CATEGORY_SLUGS = (
                (u'オタク', u'otaku'),
                (u'寿司', u'sushi'),
            )
        
        Another feature is that to define your slugify function like this::
        
            def SLUG_FUNC(value, substitutions=()):
                value = value.replace(u'禅', 'zen')
                return value
        
        These settings are on your pelicanconf.py then just work.
