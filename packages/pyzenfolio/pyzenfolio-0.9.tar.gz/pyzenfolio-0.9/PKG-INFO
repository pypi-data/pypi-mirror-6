        Light-weight Zenfolio API Python wrapper.
        
        Using this wrapper is pretty straight-forward and does not
        require to use any special data-structures. Everything is
        returned as an ``AttrDict`` (same as ``dict`` however
        dictionary items can be accessed via Python attribute
        dot notation ``foo['bar'] == foo.bar``).
        
        Example
        -------
        
        ::
        
            from pyzenfolio import PyZenfolio
        
            api = PyZenfolio(auth={'username': 'foo', 'password': 'bar'})
            api.Authenticate()
        
            # lookup user
            user = api.LoadPublicProfile()
            # AttrDict allows to access items like this
            domain = user.DomainName
            uploaded_photos = user.PhotoCount
        
            # create photoset
            photoset = api.CreatePhotoSet(
                user.RootGroup.Id,
                attr={
                    'Title': 'foo'
                }
            )
            photoset_url = photoset.PageUrl
        
            # upload image
            api.UploadPhoto(photoset, 'bar.jpg')
        
            # get image download URL
            image = api.LoadPhotoSetPhotos(photoset.Id)
            url = image.OriginalUrl
