Description: ==========
        image-view
        ==========
        
        The purpose is to support viewing Netpbm images on OS X. Xee_ works fine for
        the most part, but it doesn't work properly when displaying a subset of images
        from command line. This is important if there are a series of images captured
        from camera (``captured-00*.pgm``) and you want to display some subset of them.
