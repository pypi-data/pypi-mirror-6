Description: About
        -----
        
        READemption is a pipeline for the computational evaluation of RNA-Seq
        data. It was originally developed at the IMIB/ZINF to process dRNA-Seq
        reads (as introduced by Sharma et al., Nature, 2010 originating from
        bacterial samples. Meanwhile is has been extended to process data
        generated in different experimental setups and originating from all
        domains of life and is under active development. The subcommands which
        are accessible viaq command-line interface cover read processing and
        aligning, coverage plot generation, gene expression quantification as
        well as differential gene expression analysis. READemption was applied
        to analyze numerous data sets. In order to set up analyses quickly
        READemption follows the principal of "convention over configuration":
        Once the input files are copied into defined folders no further
        parameters have to be given. Still, READemption's behavior can be
        adapted to specific needs of the user.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Documentation can be found on

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Short version (if you have all the requirements installed):
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install READemption
        
        `Long version <http://pythonhosted.org/READemption/installation.html>`__
        (what are the requirements and how do you get them)

        Development
        -----------
        
        -  If possible follow the principal of "convention over configuration".
           This means input file are into a fixed location and the result file
           are placed in fixed location.
        
        -  The classes should be path agnostic as far a possible. The controller
           is taking care of that and calls them adequately.
        
        -  The git braching model is very close to the one proposed
           `here <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`__.
           There two main branches:
        
           -  master
           -  dev(elopment)
        
           And there are further supporting branches:
        
           -  feature branches - branched off and back to the dev branch
           -  release branches - branched off from dev and merged back into dev
              and master
           -  hotfix branches - branched off from master and merged back into
              dev and master
