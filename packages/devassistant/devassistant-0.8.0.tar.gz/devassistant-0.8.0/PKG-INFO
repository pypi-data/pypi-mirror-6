        DevAssistant - making life easier for developers
        
        DevAssistant project is a helper for all developers using (not-only) Fedora. It helps with creating and setting up basic projects in various languages, installing dependencies, setting up environment etc.
        
        DevAssistant is based on idea of per-{language/framework/...} "assistants" with hierarchical structure. E.g. you can create projects like this:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ da crt python django -n ~/myproject # sets up Django project named "myproject" inside your home dir
          $ da crt python flask -n ~/flaskproject # sets up Flask project named "flaskproject" inside your home dir
          $ da crt ruby rails -n ~/alsomyproject # sets up RoR project named "alsomyproject" inside your home dir
        
        DevAssistant also allows you to work with a previously created project, for example import it to Eclipse:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ da mod eclipse # run in project dir or use -p to specify path
        
        With DevAssistant, you can also prepare environment for developing upstream projects - either using project-specific assistants or using "custom" assistant for arbitrary projects (even those not created by DevAssistant):
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ da prep custom -u scm_url -p directory_to_save_to
        
        Last but not least, DevAssistant allows you to perform arbitrary tasks not related to a specific project:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ da task <TODO:NOTHING YET>
        
        For full documentation, see http://doc.devassistant.org/
        
        To start developing, do:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          git clone https://github.com/bkabrda/devassistant
          cd devassistant
          git submodule init
          git submodule update
        
        And install dependencies from requirements-devel.txt:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          pip install -r requirements-devel.txt
        
        Apart from git, DevAssistant also assumes that polkit is installed on your machine (provides pkexec binary). If you want to work with GUI, you'll need pygobject3.
        
        Or, assuming that you have DevAssistant version 0.8.0 or higher installed, you just need to do:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          da prep devassistant
        
        DevAssistant works on Python 2.6, 2.7 and >= 3.3.
