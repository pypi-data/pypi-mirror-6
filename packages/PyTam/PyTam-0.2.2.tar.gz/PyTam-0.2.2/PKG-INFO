        DESCRIPTION
        ===============================================================================
        PyTam is a single module that allows python3 to manipulate databases of
        its own. It works for Linux, Mac and Windows.
        It can create, delete, update, fetch, match registries and much more. It is not
        intended to be a SQL dbm but a python data persistance module that allows managing
        data in an efficent way, with more levels of security than other python's
        persistance libraries.
        
        Note: It Runs On ANDROID!!!! with QPython 3
