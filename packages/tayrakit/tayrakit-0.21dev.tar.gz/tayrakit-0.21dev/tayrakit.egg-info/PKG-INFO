Description: Tayrakit is a browser toolkit using Tayra templating language. Most popular
        toolkits are written entirely as javascript libraries that are normally fetched
        when a page gets loaded. Tayrakit adapts the opposite way. Widgets,
        also called as template plugins, are authored using a templating language so
        that html parts are kept as HTML, css parts are kept as CSS and JavaScript is
        used only where it is required - for event callbacks :)
