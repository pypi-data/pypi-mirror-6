Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.
        
        To contact the project, go to the `project home page
        <http://lxml.de/>`_ or see our bug tracker at
        https://launchpad.net/lxml
        
        In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,
        you can get it from the github repository at
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to
        build the sources, see the build instructions on the project home
        page.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will
        install lxml from
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have
        an appropriate version of Cython installed.

        =======================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * The (empty) value returned by the ``attrib`` property of Entity and Comment
          objects was mutable.
        
        * Element class lookup wasn't available for the new pull parsers or when using
          a custom parser target.
        
        * Setting Element attributes on instantiation with both the ``attrib`` argument
          and keyword arguments could modify the mapping passed as ``attrib``.
        
        * LP#1266171: DTDs instantiated from internal/external subsets (i.e. through
          the docinfo property) lost their attribute declarations.
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        * Built with Cython 0.20pre (gitrev 012ae82eb) to prepare support for
          Python 3.4.
