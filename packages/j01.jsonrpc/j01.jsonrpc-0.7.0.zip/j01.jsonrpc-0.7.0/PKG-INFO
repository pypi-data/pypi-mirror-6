        CHANGES
        =======
        
        0.7.0 (2014-03-25)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: implemented button disable concept based on button property and
          JQuery event. Take alook at the new j01.button.js javascript. Note, this
          implementation keeps event handler intact. Other concepts like the one
          used in the twitter bootstrap framework will destroy applied event handler
          during reset a button state which will not work for our implementation.
        
        - feature: implemented JQuery click event trigger. This could get used for
          different concepts like apply a loading icon etc. We also use this event
          handler for the new button disable concept.
        
        
        0.6.0 (2014-03-04)
        ------------------
        
        - javascript: use JSON2 as default instead of eval for load json repsonse.
          Fallback to custom implementation if no JSON2 is available.
        
        - javascript: update to newest history.js javascripts
        
        - javascript: implemented low level unauthorized nextURL error response
          handling in j01.proxy.js javascript.
        
        - implemented handleError method
        
        - changed unauthorized error page redirect from loginForm.html to
          j01Login.html for better customization. Note, you will need at least to
          register your existing loginForm.html as an additional j01Login.html page.
          Or the new nextURL redirect to j01Login.html will point ot a missing page.
          This changes makes it possible to show an explicit comment (session expires
          for jsonrpc call).
        
        - feature: improve history state handling. Remember initial url and support
          go back to the initial url too whcih doesn't provide a ``j`` marker argument.
        
        - feature: implemented improved json-rpc client including custom error handling
          and removed the dependency to z3c.jsonrpcproxy. This means you need to
          define the z3c.jsonrpcproxy dependency if you use the z3c.jsonrpcproxy
          javascript client in your package.
        
        
        0.5.1 (2013-03-19)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: support button action handling based on default z3c.form concept.
          This let us allow to use urls like <page-url>?form.buttons.foobar=1 for non
          jsonrpc requests
        
        - feature: implemented JSONRPCClickButton using a simple click event handler
        
        - feature: support prefixWidgets and prefixButtons property for separate
          different forms loaded into one single page.
        
        - feature: improve javascript callback handler and support scrollToExpression
          with scroll to animation after loading jsonrpc content.
        
        - support response.data.i18nMessage as additional error response given from
          z3c.jsonrpc error views
        
        
        0.5.0 (2012-11-16)
        ------------------
