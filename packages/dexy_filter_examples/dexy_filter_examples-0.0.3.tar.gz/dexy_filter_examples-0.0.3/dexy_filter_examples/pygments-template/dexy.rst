Pygments Examples
-----------------

The `pygments` filter applies syntax highlighting to source code.

Here is some raw source code::

    {{ d['hello.py'] | indent(4) }}

And here is how we specify in `dexy.yaml` that the `pyg` filter should be applied to this file::

    {{ d['dexy.yaml|idio|t']['pygments'] | indent(4) }}

The default format is HTML, so the code will come out looking like this, with HTML markup applied::

    {{ d['hello.py|pyg'] | indent(4) }}

If we follow the `pyg` filter with the `l` filter (which does nothing, but it only accepts input of documents with `.tex` extension)::

    {{ d['dexy.yaml|idio|t']['latex'] | indent(4) }}

then pygments will output LaTeX markup instead::

    {{ d['hello.py|pyg|l'] | indent(4) }}

Pygments will automatically determine which lexer to use based on the file extension of the incoming file. In the above examples, the `.py` file extension tells pygments that it should use the python lexer. If you need a different lexer than the default for the file extension, then you can pass a custom `lexer` argument::

    {{ d['dexy.yaml|idio|t']['custom-lexer'] | indent(4) }}

You can see a list of all the available lexers, the file extensions they correspond to, and the aliases you can use to specify them, as follows::

    {{ d['pygments.sh|idio|shint']['list-lexers'] | head(16) | indent(4) }}

Dexy adds some custom file extension -> lexer mappings of its own, such as `.pycon` and `.rbcon` for python console and ruby console transcripts.

Custom formatter options can also be passed. Note that these options may be different for the HTMLFormatter and, say, the LatexFormatter. For information consult the `Pygments Documentation`_ for the formatter you are using. Here is an example of setting the `noclasses` attribute to True::

    {{ d['dexy.yaml|idio|t']['html-noclasses'] | indent(4) }}

And here is the resulting HTML::

    {{ str(d['hello.py|pyg|-noclasses']) | indent(4) }}

As a reminder here is the default HTML again::

    {{ d['hello.py|pyg'] | indent(4) }}
