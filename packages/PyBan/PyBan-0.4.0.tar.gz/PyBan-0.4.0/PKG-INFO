Description: ===========================
        PyBan - Kanban with Python!
        ===========================
        
        PyBan is a Kanban board management tool for the command line.
        Its interface is implemented in curses.
        
        PyBan saves its kanban boards in the .pyban folder located in
        your home folder.
        
        The first time you run PyBan, you won't have any boards. You will
        be taken to the project settings screen where you can add a board.
        After this, make sure you choose a board as your active board,
        then you can fire away, creating tasks while feeling that much more
        productive.
        
        If you haven't heard about Kanban, I suggest you look it up on
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban.
