        Cross Platform Process Infomation (cmdline, environ) and Management
        
        ptools has windows and linux implementations of several functions:
        
        * list_pids - list all processes
        * get_pid_info - get the command line used to launch the process and
        the environment as a map
        * kill_pid - forcefully kill the process
        
        get_pid_info may fail with ptools.OperationException especially if you
        do not have the required access to see the processes command line or
        environment
        
        To get the functions for your current os do:
        
            from ptools.current import *
        
Platform: UNKNOWN
