Oraide
======

Oraide is a library to spare presenters the risky proposition of entering
terminal commands and giving a presentation at the same time. Oraide, with help
from tmux_, can make it appear as if someone is typing in a terminal session.
Itâ€™s great for live coding, demonstrations, and recording screencasts.

To learn more about installing and using Oraide, or its history, please see
`the Oraide documentation`_.

To see the source, submit bug fixes or enhancements, or to file a bug report,
please see `Oraide on GitHub`_.

The name of the library is a portmanteau of *orate* and *aide*.

Oraide is by `Daniel D. Beck`_ and is provided under the terms of a BSD-style
license. See the ``LICENSE.txt`` file included for details.
