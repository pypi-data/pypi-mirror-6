        Installation
        =============
        
        If you're lucky enough to be using Arch Linux, i3situation is available from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3situation-git/).
        
        If you want to install straight from this git repository, first clone it and then change
        into the cloned directory.
        
            git clone https://github.com/HarveyHunt/i3situation
            cd i3situation
        
        You then need to install i3situation using the setup.py file that is provided.
        
            sudo python setup.py install
            
        Next, use your editor of choice to create a configuration file.
        
            vim ~/.config/i3situation/config
            
        The minimum that you need to enter in order to run the application is as
        follows:
        
            [general]
            interval = 1
            logging_level = ERROR
            log_file = ~/.config/i3situation/log.txt
          
        You then need to change the status_command value in the bar section of your i3
        configuration to:
        
            status_command i3situation
            
        It is a good idea to run i3situation at this point, as it will handle copying over the
        plugins into your configuration directory.
            
        Configuring Plugins
        =============
        Plugins are the way to get this application to output to i3bar and allow for large
        amounts of expandability. The configuration file is automatically reloaded when
        any changes occur to it. Changing the content of a plugin file will also cause
        a reload of all plugins and settings.
        
        Plugins are configured in the config file. You must first denote a new plugin
        config section by using a unique name for that instance of a plugin. For example:
        
            [my_time_plugin]
        
        Inside this section you need to say which plugin you wish to use (Note: the plugin
        field refers to the filename of the plugin less the .py extension).
        
            [my_time_plugin]
            plugin = date_time
            
        Each plugin needs to have an interval set. This interval refers to how often the
        plugin's displayed text is updated.
        
            [my_time_plugin]
            plugin = date_time
            interval = 1
            
        Many plugins also accept a menu_command. This is a command that is executed when
        a plugin wishes to display a menu- allowing you to have extremely customisable
        menus. The command should be a dzen2 command, the options available can be seen
        [here](https://github.com/robm/dzen/wiki/_pages). As an example, here is the menu
        command that I use with the date_time plugin:
        
            [time]
            plugin = date_time
            color = #0d132b
            menu_command = cal | dzen2 -y -30 -w 200 -l 7 -p -bg "#70898f" -fg "#0d132b" -e "onstart=uncollapse;button1=exit" -fn "Inconsolata-dz for Powerline 10" -ta c -sa c
        
        You can specify the x position that dzen2 appears at by using the -x command line
        argument. Alternatively, i3situation can work out the correct x position so that
        dzen2 appears central to the mouse click and aligned to always be on the screen.
        
            
        You can then change the options for a plugin by defining them next. The available
        options can be seen in the plugin file in a dictionary- with the defaults next to it.
        
        A list of values should be comma separated and a boolean value can be written as:
        
        - on
        - True
        - true
        - off
        - False
        - false
        
        The example below illustrates using a comma separated list:
        
            [my_reddit_plugin]
            plugin = reddit
            interval = 30
            mode = subreddit
            subreddits = programming,linux
            
        You can also edit options that affect how the output is displayed (Note: the
        same options are available for all plugins). The following example illustrates
        changing the colour of the output:
        
            [my_reddit_plugin]
            plugin = reddit
            interval = 30
            mode = subreddit
            subreddits = programming,linux
            color = #808080
        
        The rest of the output options that can be edited are discussed in the Advanced Plugin 
        Options section of this document.
        
        My personal i3situation configuration file can be found with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/harvey_hunt/dotfiles).

        Creating a Plugin
        =============
        
        Creating a plugin is a simple process, made easier by the Plugin base class.
        The first step is to create a python
        file in your plugin directory. Note: Files with a leading underscore will not
        be loaded as a plugin but can be
        used for library files.
        
            vim cool_feature.py
        
        The Plugin base class needs to be imported from the plugins folder.
        
        ```python
        from plugins._plugin import Plugin
        ```    
        
        You should then create a class that inherits the newly imported Plugin class.
        
        ```python
        from plugins._plugin import Plugin
        
        
        class cool_feature_plugin(Plugin):
        ```    
        
        The \_\_all\_\_ variable needs to be set to the name of your plugin class.
        
        ```python
        from plugins._plugin import Plugin
        
        __all__ = 'CoolFeaturePlugin'
        
        
        class CoolFeaturePlugin(Plugin):
        ```
        
        The \_\_init\_\_ function needs to accept two arguments- self and config. The
        options that can be
        configured by the user need to be placed in a dictionary called self.options
        with the format:
        
        ```python
        {'option': 'default_value'}
        ```
        
        Options that can be configured by the user should be declared before calling
        the super class'
        \_\_init\_\_ function.
        
        The super class' \_\_init\_\_ function must be passed two arguments- config and
        the user configurable
        options. There is only one compulsary option- interval. This refers to how
        often (in seconds) the
        main function of the plugin should be called.
        
        ```python
        from plugins._plugin import Plugin
        
        __all__ = 'CoolFeaturePlugin'
        
        
        class CoolFeaturePlugin(Plugin):
        
            def __init__(self, config):
                self.options = {'cool_option': 'cool_value', 'interval': 1}
                super().__init__(config, self.options)
        ```
        
        All plugins must have a main() function that is called by the plugin loader.
        Within this function,
        program logic should be executed and it should return a dictionary to the main
        application. The 
        Plugin base class provides a helper function called output that serves this
        purpose. Output should
        be passed a string as the first argument that represents a detailed output of
        the plugin and a shorter
        string as the second argument. It is perfectly acceptable to pass the same
        value to each argument.
        
        ```python
        from plugins._plugin import Plugin
        
        __all__ = 'CoolFeaturePlugin'
        
        
        class CoolFeaturePlugin(Plugin):
        
            def __init__(self, config):
                self.options = {'cool_option': 'cool_value', 'interval': 1}
                super().__init__(config, self.options)
            
            def main(self):
                return self.output('This is a fabulous plugin', 'Cool plugin')
        ```
        
        It is also possible to create a function that gets executed whenever the plugin's output
        is clicked. The plugin must have an on_click() function that handles the event. The function
        must accept an event dictionary as an argument- the layout of which is below:
        
        ```
        {'button': 1, 'name': 'time', 'y': 1196, 'x': 1846}
        ```
        
        The button corresponds to which mouse button was used to click the text. The mouse buttons are 
        numbered as follows:
        
        1. Left Mouse Button
        2. Middle Mouse Button
        3. Right Mouse Button
        
        The x and y variables refer to the position that the text was clicked at.
        
        The name refers to the name of the plugin object that was clicked.
        
        It is possible to do many things once the text has been clicked, but please bear in mind that
        the on_click() code will be run in the same thread as the event handler. Therefore, it is important
        that any code in on_click() isn't too intensive.
        
        Adding an on_click() function to the cool_feature_plugin looks as follows:
        
        ```python
        from plugins._plugin import Plugin
        
        __all__ = 'CoolFeaturePlugin'
        
        
        class CoolFeaturePlugin(Plugin):
        
            def __init__(self, config):
                self.options = {'cool_option': 'cool_value', 'interval': 1}
                super().__init__(config, self.options)
            
            def main(self):
                return self.output('This is a fabulous plugin', 'Cool plugin')
            
            def on_click(self, event):
                if event['button'] == 1:
                    self.output_options['color'] = '#FF0000'
                else:
                    self.output_options['color'] = '#0000FF'
        ```
        
        If you wish to allow users to display dzen menus when a click event occurs,
        your plugin needs to call the display_dzen function. It accepts an integer
        representing the x coordinate that the dzen window should appear at. Each
        plugin has the option menu_command. This option defaults to ''. This allows
        you to have code such as the following:
        
        ```python
        from plugins._plugin import Plugin
        
        __all__ = 'CoolFeaturePlugin'
        
        
        class CoolFeaturePlugin(Plugin):
        
            def __init__(self, config):
                self.options = {'cool_option': 'cool_value', 'interval': 1}
                super().__init__(config, self.options)
            
            def main(self):
                return self.output('This is a fabulous plugin', 'Cool plugin')
            
            def on_click(self, event):
                if event['button'] == 1:
                    if self.options['menu_command'] == '':
                        self.output_options['color'] = '#FF0000'
                    else:
                        self.display_dzen(event['x'])
                else:
                    self.output_options['color'] = '#0000FF'
        ```
        
        This is all the code required to create a plugin. There are lots of good
        examples of how to write
        plugins in this [project's plugin
        directory](https://github.com/harvey_hunt/i3situation/tree/master/i3situation/plugins)
        
        Advanced Plugin Options
        =============
        
        It is also possible to manipulate many aspects of a plugin's output. The Plugin
        class provides
        a way to set the value of output options (blocks). Changing values in the
        following dictionary
        will affect the output options:
        
        ```python
        self.output_options['color'] = '#FF00FF'
        ```
        
        The following is the internal representation of output options used in the
        Plugin class.
        
        ```python
        self.output_options = {
            'color': None,
            'min_width': None,
            'align': None,
            'name': None,
            'urgent': None,
            'seperator': None,
            'seperator_block_width': None}
        ```
        
        For a full explanation of each output option, please refer to section 2.2 of
        the excellent
