        - Implemented journaling mechanism using adapters and event handlers. There are
          two adapters to journalize something on a context, one for journalizing in
          the workflow history, and one for an annotations-based journal. Which one
          is used depends on which marker interface (see interfaces.py) the type
          implements. The annotations based system is not tested yet.
