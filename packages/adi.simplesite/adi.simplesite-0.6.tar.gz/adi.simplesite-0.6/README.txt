Introduction
============

This is a Plone-4 add-on that aims to help especially smaller sites to get started quicker and easier.

The goal is to give the possibility to configure most common website-usecases via the webinterface for mortals. No programming needed.

It does this mainly by replacing viewlets with portlets.

Most functionalities are pulled in by small splitted plone-add-ons, named below, so you can roll your own combinations, installing them individually, in case you don't need parts of the whole package.



The pulled subpackages are:


- adi.init
Deletes Plone's default contents

- adi.simplestructure
Hides viewlets and adds some samaple portlets instead in top and footer via ContentWellPortlets.

- adi.samplecontent
Adds some samplecontent and sampleportlets in left- and right column.

- adi.slickstyle
Adds a decent CSS to the portal, let's you override col, bg-col and link-col globally.

- adi.dropdownmenue
Adds a main drodwonmenu on top, showing first-level-folders, replaces Plone's globalnav.
