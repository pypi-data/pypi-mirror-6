        Sample Post
        -----------
        
        A post is made up of two parts: header and body.
        
        The header is in [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml) and body is in Github Flavored Markdown,
        the two parts are separated with a '---' like separator.
        
        ```
        title = "Hello World"
        datetime = "2013-06-05 19:38"
        tags = ["sample", "some-tag"]
        ----------
        
        # Here is markdown content
        ```
        
        Commands
        ---------
        
        To deploy a new blog in new-created directory:
        
            $ lilac deploy
        
        To build site from source to htmls:
        
            $ lilac build
        
        To remove all htmls lilac built:
        
            $ lilac clean
        
        To start a simple HTTP server:
        
            $ lilac serve
        
        To watch source changes the same time when the cute web server running:
        
            $ lilac serve --watch
        
        When you save your writings, lilac can detect the changes and start rebuilding.
        
        To run lilac's server and rebuilder in the background:
        
            $ lilac start
        
        We can write blog with at most one shell session.
        
        **NOTE: ililac was removed in version 0.3.9, use `lilac start|stop instead`**
        
        Themes
        ------
        
        You really should manage your theme in a standalone git repository, and use it as a submodule of your blog's
        submodule if your blog is under git versioning too.
        
        For instance, add theme `less` a submodule of your blog's repo:
        
            $ git submodule add git://github.com/hit9/lilac-theme-less.git less
        
        If you want to modify a theme created by someone else, just fork his(or her) repo, and then modify it.
        
        But it's 100% ok to use themes not in the submodule way.

        Common Issues
        -------------
        
        - Installation troubles:
        
           cann't find Python.h. Solution: install `python-dev` package (on ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python-dev`. There's no such issue on OSX)
        
        - How to create a new post?
        
           There's no command to do it, just `touch src/post/my-new-post.md`.
