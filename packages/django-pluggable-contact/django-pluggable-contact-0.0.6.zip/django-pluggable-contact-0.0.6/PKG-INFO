Description: ========================
        django-pluggable-contact
        ========================
        
        Pluggable Django app for contact forms with database-based inbox and support for
        topic-based sorting and sending to multiple recipients based on topic. Fully
        i18n-enabled and supports South migrations. It supports HTML emails and
        automatic conversion of HTML email to plain-text.
        
        This code is still in early development, so there are things that don't work as
        expected (if at all). Do not expect it to be production-ready until v0.1.
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        django-pluggable-contact should be fairly flexible. It is designed to be able
        to handle anything from a very simple contact form to scenarios where you may
        want to send different messages to different recipients.
        
        Although it uses the Message models to store messages in the database, it is
        optional. You can send out a message even if the object is not saved. Topics are
        also optional. If you don't want the complexity of topics, you can disable them
        completely and they won't show up in the admin or the contact form.
        
        While more features will be added to this app as time goes, the overhead of
        additional features will be kept to minimum or eliminated by using appropriate
        settings for enabling them and having them disabled by default. On the other
        hand, this app will always be just a contacts app.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        1. Better docs
        
        2. Unit tests
        
        3. Add support for configuring multiple email accounts
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        TODO
        
        Add the ``contact`` app to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and call the syncdb management
        command or migrate using South.
        
        Map the URLs like so::
        
            url(r'^contact/', include('contact.urls'))
        
        You can also include the URL in i18n_patterns as the URLs are fully
        translatable.
        
        Basic usage
        ===========
        
        At very least, you want to override the provided basic templates. Please look
        at the ``contact/templates`` directory.
