Welcome to GopPy's documentation!
=================================

GopPy (Gaussian Online Processes for Python) is a pure Python module providing
a Gaussian process implementation which allows to efficiently add new data
online. I wrote this module because all other Python implementations I know did
not support efficient online updates.

The features include:

* `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_ compatible interface.
* Efficient online updates.
* Prediction of first order derivatives.
* Estimation of the log likelihood and its derivative.
* Well documented.
* `Good test coverage. <https://coveralls.io/r/jgosmann/goppy>`_
* :download:`MIT license <../LICENSE>`.
