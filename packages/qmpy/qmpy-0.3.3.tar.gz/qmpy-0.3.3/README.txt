QMPy
===========

QMPy is a loose framework of tools for undertaking large computational 
materials projects, targeted specifically at database of density functional
theory calculations but largely flexible to individual needs. The emphasis is 
on simplifying the day-to-day work of computational materials science, to let
you get to the science.

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from qmpy.materials import Structure
    from qmpy.compute import Job, Task
    from qmpy.analysis import PhaseSpace, PhaseData

Beyond command line level research, qmpy also facilitates creating
customized websites for portable viewing and conveniently checking the
progress of your work.
