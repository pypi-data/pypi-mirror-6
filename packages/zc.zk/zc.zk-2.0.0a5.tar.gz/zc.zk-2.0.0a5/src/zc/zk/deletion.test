This package is primarily concerned with service registry and
discovery.  Services are registered and found at designated provider
nodes, which may be symbolic links.

Under normal circumstances, provider nodes shouldn't be deleted.
Generally, run-time deletion of provider nodes is pathalogical and
failure should be anticipated.  There's little this package can do to
mitigate such failure.

A special case arises when a tree is refactored and when a linkes are
used to mitigate such refactoring.   Watches are created with logical
paths.  When the resolved logical path is deleted, a **one-time** attempt
will be made to reestablish the watch by re-resolving the logical
path. If a new resolved path exists, then watches are established at
the new path.
