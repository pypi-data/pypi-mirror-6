Description: 
        
        Municiaplities for which we contribute to `OneGov`_ often require a public list
        of contacts. For the customers and us this package needs to scratch the
        following itches:
        
        - The directory must not force a set of fields on the user. Each customer
          should have the option to create its own set of fields. At the same time
          there should be at least one reasonable standard.
        
        - Some fields should only be visible with certain permissions. Think mobile
          phone number.
        
        - Elected officials are part of many comitees and councils. It must be easy
          to define the timespans during which any person was part of such an
          organization. It must also always be clear what the role of the person was.
        
        Design
        ------
        
        This is how we plan to scratch the aforementioned itches:
        
        - We give the user the possiblity to define a list of people. Each list
          consists of a number of dexterity objects with IPerson behavior. Within
          one list only one dexterity type is allowed.
        
        - Through the schema of the dexterity type we define the fields, their
          required read and write permissions, the fields shown in the list, the order
          of those fields, the fields available for filtering in the list, and the 
          fields shown in the detail view.
        
        - These dexterity types may be installed by any package or they may be included
          in seantis.people, available through separate profiles. (It's technically
          even possible to create them through the web, but we don't recommend this
          approach for various reasons.)
        
        - We devine an organzation-behavior which any folderish dexterity type may 
          adapt. Types with that behavior may then have people added to them with
          entry, exit and role information.
        
        - We display the memberships of each person using the entry, exit and role
          information. We identity the organization solely by url and title. This will
          give users the ability to have some plone page act as an organization, which
          frees os from having to reinvent the wheel there.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        The people types and list are pretty much ready for a first release. We are
        currently working on the organisation part of the module.
