versionup is an auto version tool with a command line utility

go to any directory with a setup.py and call either
upversion or showversion
and it will do the rest.



if you tell it not to set up your setup.py file
then add 
from versionup import get_version
version = get_version()

# then replace your
'version' : 'x.x.x', or 'version = 'x.x.x',
# with
'version' : version  or 'version' = version,

or just let it do it for you...


to install
just
sudo python setup.py install
