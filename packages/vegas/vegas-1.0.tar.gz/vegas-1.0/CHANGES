Version 1.0 - 2013-12-21
==========================
This is the first version of a new implementation
of the vegas algorithm for adaptive multidimensional
Monte Carlo integration. It is written in Python/Cython
and features a significantly improved algorithm
relative to earlier versions of vegas. In particular
it now uses two adaptive strategies instead of one.
