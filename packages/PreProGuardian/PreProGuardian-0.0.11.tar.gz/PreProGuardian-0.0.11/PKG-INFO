Description: PreProGuardian is a class that allows you to run multiple preprocessor compilation watchers with one python class 
        (and one config file and some luck).
        
        ## Supported preprocessors stack:
        
        SASS
        Jade
        Coffee
        
        Will be extended (maybe) later, since I use it for my own projects, and will add watchers as soon as they're needed.
        
        Needless to say, PreProGuard assumes that you have cli utilites for each of preprocessors installed.
        (npm install coffeescript, npm install jade, npm install sass)
        
        ## Usage:
        
        ```
        from ppguard import Guardian
        g = Guardian("path/to/config.json")
        g.run()
        ```
        
        ## Folders structure:
        
        PreProGuardian assumes that you have two main folders - one for sources (option 'sources_root') and one 
        for results (option 'static_root').
        
        For each folder in sources dir there must be one in results, but not vice versa - you can have any number 
        of folders and files existing only in results/.
        
        If option 'consistency_check' is set to 1 it will ask if you want to create in compiled files folder any folders that 
        exists only in source folder. For example: you can create folder "stylesheets" only in sources/ dir, 
        and if consistency_check is set to 1, on the first run script will ask if you want to create results/stylesheets/.
        
        ## Folders to watch
        
        config options 'sass', 'jade' and 'coffee' consists of lists of folders with respect to sources_root where 
        PreProGuard can find source files.
        
        ## Django management command.
        
        I use ppguard in my django projects, with following code:
        
        app_name/management/commands/preprocessors.py:
        ```
        from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
        from ppguard import Guardian
        
        class Command(BaseCommand):
        	def handle(self, *args, **options):
        		g = Guardian("/path/to/config.json")
        		g.run()
        ```
        python manage.py preprocessors
        
        :)
        
        
        ## Misc
        
        It is possible (since v. 0.0.4) to pass variables to jade. You can pass them using 'jade-options' config, 
        and then use in your templates via #{fieldName}.
        
        Sample config file:
        
        {
        	"sources_root"      : "static-sources/",
        	"static_root"       : "static/",
        	"jade-options"      : {"some": "Dict object", "to": "Pass into templates :)"},
        	"consistency_check" : 1,
        	"sass":       ["app/styles/", "stylesheets/"],
        	"jade":       ["app/partials/", "templates/"],
        	"coffee":     ["app/controllers/", "app/directives/", "jquery-widgets/"]
        }
