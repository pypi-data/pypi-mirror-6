Description: **A Python Module to Interact with NASA's ADS that Doesn't Suckâ„¢**
        ==================================================================
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andycasey/ads-python.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andycasey/ads-python) [![PyPi download count image](https://pypip.in/d/ads/badge.png)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ads/)
        
        If you're in research, then you pretty much _need_ NASA's ADS. It's tried, true, and people go crazy on the rare occasions when it goes down.
        
        **Getting Started**
        
        1. You'll need an API key from NASA ADS labs. Sign up for the newest version of ADS search [here](http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/user/signup), then you can apply for API access by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFJZbHp1WERWU3hQVVJnZFJjbE05SGc6MQ#gid=0).
        
        2. When you get your API key, save it to a file called ``~/.ads/dev_key`` or save it as an environment variable named ``ADS_DEV_KEY``
        
        3. From a terminal type ``pip install ads`` (or [if you must](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install), use ``easy_install ads``)
        
        Happy Hacking!

        A short list of [examples](https://github.com/andycasey/ads-python/tree/master/examples) are included, and there are more to come.
