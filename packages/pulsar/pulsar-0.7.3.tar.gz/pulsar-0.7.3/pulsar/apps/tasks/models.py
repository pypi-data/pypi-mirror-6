'''
An application implements several :class:`Job`
classes which specify the way each :ref:`task <apps-taskqueue-task>` is run.
Each :class:`Job` class is a task-factory, therefore,
a :class:`.Task` is always associated
with one :class:`Job`, which can be of two types:

* standard (:class:`Job`)
* periodic (:class:`PeriodicJob`), a generator of scheduled tasks.

.. _job-callable:

Implementing jobs
========================

To define a job is simple, subclass from :class:`Job` and implement the
**job callable method**::

    from pulsar.apps import tasks

    class Addition(tasks.Job):

        def __call__(self, consumer, a, b):
            "Add two numbers"
            return a+b

The ``consumer``, instance of :class:`.TaskConsumer`,
is passed by the :ref:`Task backend <apps-taskqueue-backend>` and should
always be the first positional parameter in the callable method.
The remaining (optional) positional and key-valued parameters are needed by
your job implementation.

A :ref:`job callable <job-callable>` can also return a
:ref:`coroutine <coroutine>` if it needs to perform asynchronous IO during its
execution::

    class Crawler(tasks.Job):

        def __call__(self, consumer, sample, size=10):
            response = yield http.request(...)
            content = response.content
            ...

This allows for cooperative task execution on each task thread workers.

.. _job-non-overlap:

Non overlapping Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :attr:`Job.can_overlap` attribute controls the way tasks are generated
by a specific :class:`Job`. By default, a :class:`Job` creates a new task
every time the :ref:`task backend <apps-taskqueue-backend>` requests it.

However, when setting the :attr:`Job.can_overlap` attribute to ``False``,
a new task cannot be started unless a previous task of the same job
is done.
