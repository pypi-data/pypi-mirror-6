2.0.9
-----

~~~~~~~~~~

- html entered into parameters is no lounger doubly escaped on saving
  the document.

2.0.7
-----

Features Added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- added support for 'elaborate' code sources, that show their

  toolbox. Useful when code sources have a large number of
  variables.

- component registration now done using Silva 2.0 zcml
  directives SilvaExternalSources no longer works with Silva 1.6

0.13
----

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed Silva External Sources to use new i18n machinery.

- Available code sources are sorted on title when presented as a list.

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Titles were not stored as unicode strings.
  Moved the setting of the title to *after* the creation
  of the source, so that we can get an encoding from somewhere
  and use it to convert to unicode. Unfortunately this somewhere is a
  hard coded string for now, since Zope 2 doesn't seem to allow
  anything else.

- ZMI parameter forms are now utf-8 by default.

- Fixed unicode bug when using non-ascii chars in field titles (Kupu
  specific, port from 0.10 branch).

0.12
----

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes to security declarations to stop Zope 2.8.5+ startup warnings.

- Some HTML template cleanups.

- Import registerDirectory from Silva's fssite.

------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed unicode bug in SQL statement, this didn't support non-ascii
  characters yet.

- Fixed conditionals in the layout template, setting ``show_caption`` and
  ``show_column_heading`` should now have an effect.

0.10.2
------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed typo in add_submit script for CSVSource.

  to find code sources as the rest of Silva.

~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed missing import for Silva.i18n.translate

0.10
----

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- i18n, German translation.

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The layout pagetemplate for rendering the SQL result set now
  gets more information about the columns names and their
  order. The pagetemplates of existing SQL Source instances need
  to be updated to make use of this information.

0.9.1
-----
