            <h2>What's this?</h2>
            <p>
                {{ WWW_HOST }} is a <b>dynamic dns service</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You usually need it so your router (or other dyndns2-compatible
                client) can update a hostname, so you don't need to know or find
                out your current IP address.
            </p>
            <p>
                {{ WWW_HOST }} is <b>simple, usable, free, friendly, secure and respects your privacy</b>.

            <ul>
                <li>nagging its users to make a paid subscription</li>
                <li>annoying its users with advertisements or spam</li>
                <li>cancelling hosts or accounts after a short period of non-usage</li>
                <li>hiding the few free features almost undiscoverably
                    between a ton of commercial-only features</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How is it?</h2>
            <p>
                You can just try it using the test account (see Register page).

            <p>
                The only thing we expect from you is fair use of this service:

                <li>Don't do updates if your IP did not change.</li>
                <li>Don't create lots of users or lots of hosts.</li>
                <li>Don't use the service for any illegal or otherwise questionable purpose.</li>
                <li>Don't spam us via e-mail.</li>
