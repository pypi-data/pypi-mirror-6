Description: **A Python module to interact with NASA's ADS that doesn't suckâ„¢**
        ==================================================================
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andycasey/ads-python.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andycasey/ads-python)
        
        If you're in research, then you pretty much _need_ NASA's ADS. It's tried, true, and people go crazy on the rare occasions when it goes down.
        
        
        
        **Getting Started**
        
        1. You'll need an API key from NASA ADS labs first. You can apply for one [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFJZbHp1WERWU3hQVVJnZFJjbE05SGc6MQ#gid=0).
        
        2. When you get your API key, save it to a file called ``~/.ads/dev_key``
        
        3. Happy hacking. Pull requests are welcomed.
