Description: ==================
        Density Estimation
        ==================
        
        This package provides functions for three specific types of density estimators.  
        You might find it most useful for tasks involving plotting kernel density estimates, 
        histograms and nearest-neighbor density estimates.
        
        Typical intallation often looks like this::
        
            !pip install densityestimation

        Examples
        ========

        Contributors
        =============
        
        We would like to thank our professor, Brian Chapman, for guiding us
        through our first ever endeavors involving Python.  It is because of
        you, this class and this project that density estimation in Python
        will never be the same, or at least in our eyes.
