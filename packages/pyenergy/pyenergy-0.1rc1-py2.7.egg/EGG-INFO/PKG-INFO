Description: Platform run
        ============
        
        These scripts form the basis to easily run binaries on a range of platforms.
        Details of the platforms and how they're set up are given below.
        
        The script itself accepts two arguments, a platform to run on and the name of
        the executable file. The configure script can be used to find the locations of
        various executables needed by the various platforms. By default the configure
        script will not generate code for a specific platform if the prerequisites
        cannot be found.
        
        List of platforms
        -----------------
        
        ### STM32F0DISCOVERY
        
        This board contains a cortex-m0. Stlink is used as a gdb-server and an arm
        debugger is used to flash the code to the board.
        
        Platform name: stm32f0discovery
        
        Prerequisites for running:
         - st-util (st-link package)
         - arm-none-eabi-gdb (or other arm gdb-compatible debugger)
        
        
        ### ATMEGA328P
        
        This is an ATMEGA328P chip, loaded with an arduino compatible bootloader. This
        is programmed with a USB to serial converter and avrdude. This was tested on a
        breadboarded ATMEGA328P chip, with a FTDI USB to serial converter.
        
        Platform name: atmega328p
        
        Prerequisites for running:
         - avrdude
         - avr-objcopy
        
        
        ### PIC32MX250F128B
        
        This is a 32-bit pic chip, tested on a breadboard and hooked up to a pickit2.
        This requires pic32prog (so that no bootloader is needed on the PIC chip) and
        the pic32 tools to convert the elf to a hex file.
        
        Platform name: pic32mx250f128b
        
        Prerequisites for running:
         - pic32prog
         - pic32-objcopy
        
        
        Measurement configuration
        -------------------------
        
        The measurement configuration file tells platformrun about the energy monitors
        connectted to the platforms, and some additional details about the platforms.
        For example, to measure the stm32f0discovery, the application needs to know the
        serial number of the energy measurement device, as well as the measurement
        point and the shunt resistor value. Other platforms have additional details,
        such as atmega328p, which needs to know the ID of the USB-serial adaptor.
        
        The measurement config is a standard JSON format file, and by default is loaded 
        from ~/.measurementrc.
        
        ### Basic configuration
        
        Keys:
         - energy-monitor. This specifies the serial number of the energy monitor that
           is used for this platform.
         - trigger-pin.  This specifies the pin on which the platform will trigger the
           energy monitor.
         - measurement-point. Which measurement point is connected to the platform.
         - resistor. The value of the shunt resistor that intercept's the platform's
           power supply.
         
        ### Platform specific keys
        
        Keys for atmega328p:
         - serial-dev. This specifies the ID of the USB to serial device. This ID comes
           directly from the link found in /dev/serial/by-id/ when the adapter is
           plugged in. By selecting the ID this way, multiple similar USB-serial
           adapters can be uniquely specified.
        
        Keys for pic32mx250f128b:
         - serial-number. This specifies the serial number of the pickit2 connected to
           the platform (not currently used).
