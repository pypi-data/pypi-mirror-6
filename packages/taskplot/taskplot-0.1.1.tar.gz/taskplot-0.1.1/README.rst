TaskPlot - Plot your tasks
==========================

TaskPlot is a command line tool as well as a Python library module that
may be used from the command line or from another program to plot
progress in multiple tasks in a single graph.

Requirements
------------
This package should be used with Python 3.4 or any later version of
Python interpreter.

On a Windows system, the following packages must be installed for
Python 3.4 from <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>:
numpy, dateutil, pyparsing, six and matplotlib.

On a Linux system, the python3-matplotlib package and the packages it
depends on must be installed. On a Debian system, the following command
may be used to install the required packages and execute the script::

    aptitude install python3-matplotlib

This package uses the Matplotlib library to plot graphs. 

Installation
------------
You can install this package using pip3 using the following command::

    pip3 install taskplot

You can install this package from source distribution. To do so,
download the latest .tar.gz file from
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/taskplot>, extract it, then open command
prompt or shell, and change your current directory to the directory
where you extracted the source distribution, and then execute the
following command::

    python3 setup.py install

Note that on a Windows system, you may have to replace ``python3`` with
the path to your Python 3 interpreter.

Getting started
---------------
There are three ways to feed data to TaskPlot and let it plot graphs.

1. Using a task directory containing task files: Let us assume your
   current directory contains the following files and contents::

    -- 2014-02-01.txt --
    READING: [xx] [xx]
    MUSIC: [xx] [xx]
    READING: [x]

    -- 2014-02-03.txt --
    READING: [x]
    CODING: [xx]

    -- 2014-02-04.txt --
    READING: [xx] [x]
    MUSIC: [xx]

    -- 2014-02-08.txt --
    MUSIC: [xx]
    CODING: [xx] [xx]

    -- 2014-02-10.txt --
    READING: [xx]
    MUSIC: [xx]
    READING: [xx]
 
   Execute the following command in the current directory::

    taskplot

   The above command will plot a graph from those files and save it in
   a file called taskplot.png

2. Using a task list file: Let us assume your current directory contains
   a file called tasklist.txt with the following content::

    DATE        READING  MUSIC     CODING
    2014-02-01  1.0      0.5       0.0
    2014-02-03  0.5      0.0       1.0
    2014-02-04  0.5      0.5       0.5
    2014-02-05  0.5      0.0       0.5
    2014-02-08  0.5      0.5       1.5

    DATE        CHESS    MUSIC     CODING
    2014-02-09  1.0      0.5       0.5
    2014-02-10  1.5      1.0       0.5
    2014-02-11  0.5      1.0       1.0
    2014-02-12  2.0      0.5       0.0
    2014-02-15  0.0      0.0       0.5

   Execute the following command in the current directory::

    taskplot tasklist.txt

   The above command will plot a graph from those files and save it in
   a file called taskplot.png

3. Using your own program: Here is an example program::

    import taskplot
    import datetime

    taskplot = taskplot.TaskPlot()
    taskplot.add_effort('READING', datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 1), 0.5)
    taskplot.add_effort('READING', datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 5), 1.0)
    taskplot.add_effort('READING', datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 8), 0.5)
    taskplot.add_effort('READING', datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 12), 0.5)
    taskplot.add_effort('CODING', datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 1), 1.0)
    taskplot.add_effort('CODING', datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 3), 1.0)
    taskplot.add_effort('CODING', datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 7), 1.0)
    taskplot.add_effort('MUSIC', datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 9), 1.0)
    taskplot.add_effort('MUSIC', datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 15), 1.0)
    taskplot.print_summary()
    taskplot.plot_graph()
    taskplot.save_graph('taskplot.png')

   Executing this program using Python 3 interpreter will plot a graph
   and generate the following graph.
