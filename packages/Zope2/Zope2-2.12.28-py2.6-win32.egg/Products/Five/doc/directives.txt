ZCML Directives supported by Five
=================================

Five tries to use the Zope 3 ZCML directives where possible, though
does sometimes subset the possible attributes. It also introduces a
few directives of its own under the ``five`` namespace.

Directives are listed per namespace, in alphabetic order.

zope ``http://namespaces.zope.org/zope``
========================================

adapter
-------

Hook an adapter factory to an interface.

class
-----

Declare interface and permissions on classes. Declares Zope 2 permissions.

permission
----------

Way to make Zope 2 permissions available to Five, ``title`` is
permission name.

redefinePermission

Redefine a permission in included ZCML as another one.

utility
-------

Declare a global utility.

interface
---------

Register an interface in ZCML.

hook
----

Install a hook on a hookable object.

browser ``http://namespaces.zope.org/browser``
==============================================

page
----

Declare a page view for an interface. Permission is a Zope 2
permission.

pages
-----

Declare multiple page views for an interface. Permissions are Zope 2
permissions.

defaultView
-----------

Declare the name of the view that should be used for the default when viewing
the object; i.e. when the object is traversed to without a view.

implements
----------

Make a class declare it implements an interface.

loadProducts
------------

Loads ZCML in all Zope 2 products. First processes all ``meta.zcml``
files, then processes all ``configure.zcml`` files.

loadProductsOverrides
---------------------

Loads overriding ZCML in all products (``overrides.zcml``).

sizable
-------

Retrieve size information for a Zope 2 content class via a Zope 3
style ``ISized`` adapter.

containerEvents
---------------

Make events be sent for Zope 2 container objects, instead of calling old
methods like ``manage_afterAdd``. These old methods will still be called
for classes specified in a ``deprecatedManageAddDelete`` directive.

deprecatedManageAddDelete
-------------------------

Specify a class that needs its old deprecated methods like
``manage_afterAdd``, ``manage_beforeDelete`` and ``manage_afterClone``
to be called. Modern classes should use event subscribers instead.

Loads all files with .pt extension in a directory as pages.

registerClass

Registers Five content with Zope 2.
