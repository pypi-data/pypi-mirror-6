        SilvaFind
        =========
        
        Silva Find is an extension for `Silva`_ to allow easy creation of search forms
        and result pages, both for users of the public site and for authors in the SMI.
        
        Authors can add a *Silva Find* object anywhere and define which fields to
        make searchable by end users of the public site, and/or which fields to
        limit to a preset value. Authors also can determine which fields should be
        displayed in the search results. All metadata set/fields are supported.
        
        By default all possible custom search criterion fields and result fields are
        available in the SMI. Besides that, the elements of all metadata sets are also
        available as result fields. If these fields are indexed in the catalog, they
        can also be used as search criterion fields. All available fields can be
        enabled/disabled in the SMI.
        
        Besides this behavior, SilvaFind also allows you to manually override the list
        of search criteria.

        1.1.4
        -----
        
        Features added:
        
        - SilvaFind does not add a default search instance inside
          the service_find directory anymore. This was only being
          used by the dlcms, which will add it anyway, if it's not there.
        
        1.1.3 (2008/03/03)
        ------------------
        
        Changes:
        
        - SilvaFind is now using Silva 2.0 zcml extension
          registration.  From this version forward this
          product will not work in Silva 1.6 or lower.
        
        - Changed product to work with Silva 2.1
          zcml extension registration.
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - metatypecriterion used all types when no selection was
          made in SMI, it should have used all *available* types
          instead since this could be overwritten with an adapter.
        
        1.1.2
        -----
        
        Changes:
        
        - i18n readied for Silva 2.0+.
        
        - Changed product to work with Silva 2.1
          zcml extension registration.
        
        1.1.1.2
        -------
        
        Changes:
        
        - metatypecriterion allows for list values.
        
        - Some code refactoring in MetatypeCriterionView, so it's easier
          to override.
        
        - Changed the line and border colors in the public view from green
          to gray and removed a green background so it's less likely that
          the SilvaFind colors will conflict with a user's site design.
        
        - Empty searches show nothing instead of everything.
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - Removed hardcoded Silva Document checks in favor of IVersion
          interfaces.
        
        - KeyError for meta_type when doing empty searches.
        
        - SilvaFind search was searching on all "search content" fields,
          and ignoring the checkboxes.
        
        1.1.1
        -----
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        
        - Getting path criterion value from request failed because paths
          in the catalog can't have unicode characters.
