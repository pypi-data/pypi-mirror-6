Description: ===============================
         Narc Testrun Finished Plugin
        ===============================
        
        Normally when testruns in slick (http://code.google.com/p/slickqa) are finished, the program
        that uploaded the results marks the testrun as finished.  This is not possible in some
        scenarios, including when doing distributed testing.
        
        This plugin watches testrun updates, and whenever a testrun that had NO_RESULT results no
        longer has NO_RESULT results, it marks the testrun as finished.  This will trigger the
        emails in narc.
