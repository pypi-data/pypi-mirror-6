Description: 
        If you encounter a top-level exception while running a python program in a
        tty, this package will give you the option to continue execution anyway like a
        deranged lunatic.
        
        Once you are executing things in this mode, things get a bit weird. The stack
        will have strange entries on it, unassigned local variables will take on the
        value None, and if you yield from a generator something will go wrong (most
        likely the program will disappear from the stack and you'll immediately exit).
        
        Tested on CPython 2.7 only.
