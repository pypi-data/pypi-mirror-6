Description: PyKat
        ===========
        
        PyKat is a wrapper for using FINESSE (http://www.gwoptics.org/finesse).
        It aims to provide a Python toolset for automating more complex tasks
        as well as providing a GUI for manipulating and viewing simulation
        setups.
        
        
        Finesse Test Server
        ----------------------
        
        A Flask based website that runs the Finesse test suites is included in PyKat. This can be hosted in Apache or run as a development server for quick testing on a system. This is a developer tool for testing FINESSE against a selection of known test cases.
        
        Prerequistes:
            Flask
            Numpy
            
        Command to start server:
        
        ::
        
          python -m pykat.test.web_server --path=[path to create website] --port=[HTTP port] --git-bin=[path to git binary]
        
        The website can then be accessed in a web browser at the address: localhost:[port]
