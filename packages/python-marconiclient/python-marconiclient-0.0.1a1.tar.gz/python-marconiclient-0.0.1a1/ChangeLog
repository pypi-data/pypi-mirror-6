    Add a Message resource and a MessageIterator
    
    This patch defines the Message resource and the MessageIterator. The
    former represents a message unit and the possible operations that can be
    executed from that resource. The later allows users to iterate over
    Messages' pages and consume all available messages.
    
    The patch also renames queue_id to queue._name which is more consistent
    with the API terminology.
    
    NOTE: Functional tests are missing and will be added in a separate
    patch.

    Make pbr only a build-time dependency.
    
    This lets you build python-marconiclient packages that don't require pbr
    to be installed at all. You would need pbr on the machine running
    rpmbuild / debuild, but not on the machines that install the packages.
    
    Unfortunately, this does not make python-marconiclient able to be
    installed via pip 0.3.1 on Lucid; you'll need to uninstall the system
    python-pip package and install a new pip some other way. Given that pip
    < 1.3 doesn't perform SSL certificate validation for pypi (trivial MITM
    attack, anyone?), you'd probably want to get a new pip anyway.

    Remove the dependency on oslo.config
    
    Client libraries shouldn't depend on specific configuration libraries,
    since that will make it difficult for other applications to adopt the
    library.
    
    This patch replaces all oslo.config usages with dictionaries. The client
    will use those as options holders and all parameters are considered
    optional.
    
    Notice that `options` was preferred instead of `**options` since this
    dictionary is considered a 'config object' and not a set of optional
    parameters. This will make it easier for applications using
    marconiclient to hold a single, mutable instance of options to pass
    around.

    fix: import-time side effect on errors
    
    A subtle module mismatch occurs when importing:
    
        from marconiclient.transport import errors
    
    This actually brings in marconiclient.errors, rather than the expected
    marconiclient.transport.errors. This patch addresses the issue, which
    was caused by import-time side effects in
    marconiclient.transport.__init__.

    Implement queue's API methods
    
    This patch implements methods for every queue operation. The 2
    operations left out in this patch are: queue_list and queue_stats.
    
    This patch makes the client, officially, usable as a library. An example
    of how this could be use:
    
        client = Client()
        queue = client.queue('my_queue') # Creates the queue automatically
        queue.metadata() # Get's metadata from the queue
        queue.metadata(dict(new_meta='Yo yo!'))
        queue.delete()
    
    Metadata was implemented as method instead of as a property to make it
    explicit that both get and set do something in the remote server.
    
    The client API was implemented in 2 separate levels. The highest level
    is the one shown in the example above, which allows users to just query
    Marconi instances without worrying about the transport, request build
    process, references, deserealization and what not. The lowest instead,
    allows the user to control every bit of the communication process - the
    user can pick a specific transport, or pass custom params. For example -
    which will make it possible to have other implementations around that
    API in addition to the asynchronous support. Example of the API:
    
        transport = http.HttpTransport(cfg.CONF)
        request = request.prepare_request(cfg.CONF,
                                          endpoint='http://localhost:8888')
        core.queue_create(transport, request, 1, callback=my_callback)
    
    There are tons of things to do and improve. For example:
    
        * The way config params are registered may work when using
        marconiclient as a library but they won't when using it as a CLI
        tool.
        * This code lacks of logging.
        * Handling of 20(1|4) is missing.

    Implement HTTP Transport
    
    This patch implements the HTTP transport.
    
    Some notes:
        - Consider not having a version for the transport implementation
          since we already have one for the API definition.
        - Consider moving transport implementations under a private package
          since they're not suppose to be inherited nor imported. To load a
          transport users have to use `transport.get_transport(_for)`

    Make the request object API aware
    
    The patch makes the Request object aware of the API but not dependent on
    it. This gives to the Request object - and to the each transport
    implementation - more information about what the current operation is
    suppose to do, what params it accepts and what methods it can handle.
    
    For example, a transport could use the API info to build the final URL
    based on the ref specified there.

    Complete refactor of api.py
    
    This patch introduces validation through jsonschema instead of using a
    custom format. In order for other API versions to extend this, this
    patch implements a base API under transport.api that should be extended
    for every API version.
    
    An example of this can be found in test_api.py, future patches will have
    more realistic examples and extensions of this class.
    
    The patch also moves api.py under v1/ since Api definitions are version

commit 9d917b7db1a03faa090578d2a79fb23a87562d02
Author: Flavio Percoco <flaper87@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Sep 27 16:38:40 2013 +0200

    Add prepare_request function to requests.py
    
    This function is supposed to be called to prepare a request that will be
    used later by other parts of this client.
    
    Future patches will more clearly show how this function is meant to be
    used.
    
    Implements blueprint python-marconiclient-v1

    Add a base transport class
    
    This patch adds a base transport class which should be used by all
    transports implementations. The patch also adds a Response class, which
    implements a common response object to use between the client API and
    the transport API.

    This adds a transport layer request spec class
    
    The idea here is to be declarative i.e. specify *what* is desired.
    It's up to the respective transport (e.g. http, zmq etc.) to turn a
    request spec into an appropriate request.
    
    The request spec class also performs some basic validation.  The
    assumption is that the Marconi API is stable and known for a given
    version. The API info for version 1 is thus captured in the code and
    not read from the home document.
    
    Nevertheless I have introduced a separate api_info() function that
    allows us to source the API info from the home document at a later point.
    
    Please note also that the `request.Spec` has a `headers` dict property
    that can be used by the auth layer to inject auth tokens etc.

    Implement message controller.
    
    This patchset contributes a message controller for Marconi client. It
    implements simple property querying for messages, as well as the
    ability to reload these properties as needed (polling?) and delete a
    message. It also uses the assumed structure of the HTTPclient that
    will form the basis of the connection from the common libraries.
    
    six is used to boost py3k compat.
    
    This also introduces a directory structure for supporting multiple
    transports. Instead of having a 'controller' dir, now we have a
    'transports/http' and 'transports/zmq'.

    This reverts commit 4b9b0139641f0e85805783d69dfc3650885cd24a.
    
    Rationale: the apiclient library needs many fixes and updates that we
    are not able to address at this time. In the future, we may consider
    returning to using it, but for now, we will implement a base
    connection module from which this client will be able to speak to
    marconi servers.
