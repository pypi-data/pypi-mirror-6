Description: Morepath: Python web microframework with super powers
        =====================================================
        
        Morepath is a Python web framework. An application consists of
        *models*. Each type of model is published on a URL *path*. Content is
        exposed to the web using *views*.

        CHANGES
        *******
        
        0.2 (2014-04-24)
        ================
        
        - Python 3 support, in particular Python 3.4 (Alec Munro - fudomunro
          on github).
        
        - Link generation now takes ``SCRIPT_NAME`` into account.
        
        - Morepath 0.1 had a security system, but it was undocumented. Now it's
          documented (docs now in :doc:`security`), and some of its behavior was slightly tweaked:
        
          * new ``verify_identity`` directive.
        
          * ``permission`` directive was renamed to ``permission_rule``.
        
          * default unauthorized error is 403 Forbidden, not 401 Unauthorized.
        
          * ``morepath.remember`` and ``morepath.forbet`` renamed to
            ``morepath.remember_identity`` and ``morepath.forget_identity``.
        
        - Installation documentation tweaks. (Auke Willem Oosterhoff)
        
        - ``.gitignore`` tweaks (Auke Willem Oosterhoff)
        
        0.1 (2014-04-08)
        ================
        
        - Initial public release.
