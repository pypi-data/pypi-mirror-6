        Donkey Simple is an extremely simple CMS that allows you to build a
        static website either from a web interface or the command line.
        
        It uses clever tools like `Ace Code Editor <http://ace.c9.io/>`__,
        `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`__ and
        `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__ to make writing the site as
        painless as possible.
        
        The pages, templates, static files and config files which make up the
        site are stored in a git repository so you can easily manage the version
        history of your site.
        
        Once you've written your site, it is generated **ONCE** and then saved
        as static files, meaning the site is **FAST**, **REALLY FAST** in a way
        dynamic sites build from templates using lots of database calls and slow
        interpretted languages so rarely are.
        
        DonkeySimple was built to work with Apache (it comes with .htaccess
        files) but it should be extremely simple to use it with other server.
        Similarly it has only been tested on Linux and Mac OS, however there's
        nothing fundamental to stop it running on windows.
        
        View the code and download it at
        https://github.com/samuelcolvin/donkey-simple. Donkey Simple is
        available through PyPi
        `here <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/DonkeySimple/>`__.
        
        Documentation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        (These docs assume you're setting up Donkey Simple to work with Apache
        on Ubuntu, but they should give you the gist of the process on other
        linux variants and Mac OS, even Windows and other web servers (like
        nginx and lighttpd) shouldn't be that different.)
        
        To Install run:
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip install DonkeySimple
        
        You should then be able to use the command line utility
        ``donkeysimple``.
        
        To build a new site run
        
        ::
        
            donkeysimple build my_new_site
        
        which will create a new site template at
        ``working/directory/my_new_site``. Eg. you might think of running this
        command from ``/var/www/home/`` to create ``/var/www/my_new_site``.
        
        (More details on what the donkeysimple utility can do can be found by
        running ``donkeysimpl --help``.)
        
        At this stage you might think about changing the password for the
        default user, you can do this by going into ``my_new_site`` and running.
        
        ::
        
            donkeysimple edituser
        
        The only remaining step is to setup apache to work with this directory.
        I won't go into details of setting up an apache site, the only "special"
        thing you need to do is enable ``.htaccess`` files, there are details
        `here <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnablingUseOfApacheHtaccessFiles>`__
        but basically just need something like
        
        ::
        
            <Directory /var/www/home/my_new_site>
                AllowOverride All
            </Directory>
        
        You should then be able to go to the site at
        http://ww.example.com/my\_new\_site to see the default site and
        http://ww.example.com/my\_new\_site/edit to login and start building
        your site.
        
        Building (You can Probably ignore this)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you download the source (eg. from github as opposed to installing
        with pip) you should run ``python mini_build.py`` prior to installing.
        All this does is download the static files for the web interface and
        generate the docs.txt file for PyPi's ``long_description``, for this you
        will require pandoc and pyandoc.
