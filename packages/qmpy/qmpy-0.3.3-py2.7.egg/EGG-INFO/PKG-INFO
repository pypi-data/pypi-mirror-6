        QMPy
        ===========
        
        QMPy is a loose framework of tools for undertaking large computational 
        materials projects, targeted specifically at database of density functional
        theory calculations but largely flexible to individual needs. The emphasis is 
        on simplifying the day-to-day work of computational materials science, to let
        you get to the science.

            from qmpy.materials import Structure
            from qmpy.compute import Job, Task
            from qmpy.analysis import PhaseSpace, PhaseData
        
        Beyond command line level research, qmpy also facilitates creating
        customized websites for portable viewing and conveniently checking the
        progress of your work.
