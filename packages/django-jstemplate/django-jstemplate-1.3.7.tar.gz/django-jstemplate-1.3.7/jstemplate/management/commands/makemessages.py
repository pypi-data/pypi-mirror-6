"""In order to avoid having to send our project's translation mapping to the
client, we have built-in the ability to preprocess i18n tags in the mustache
templates.

There aren't any nice solutions here.  The code behind ``makemessages``
unfortunately isn't extensible, so we can:

  * Duplicate the command + code behind it.
  * Offer a separate command for Mustache tag extraction.
  * Try to get Django to offer hooks into makemessages().
  * Monkey-patch.

We are currently doing that last thing. In this case we override the templatize
method.  Templatize takes a template, extracts the translatable strings (along
with desired metadata), and generates a file that xgettext knows how to parse,
e.g. a file with Python syntax.  We override this function to find
Mustache-tagged strings if the file that we are templatizing is in one of the
paths found by the active MUSTACHEJS_FINDERS.
