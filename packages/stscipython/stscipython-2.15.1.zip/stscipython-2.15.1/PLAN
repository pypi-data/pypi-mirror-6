minimal disruption plan for transition of stsci_python install
--

1. split stsci_python into packages (installs only)

	- each package in stsci_python is installed separately

	- there is no migration to setup.cfg, d2to1, etc

	- the install does not use dependencies between packages
	( --single-version-externally-managed )

	- no change to layout of subversion repository

	- the master stsci_python install is a shell script for use
	in our development environment

	- there are shell scripts that create a source tar file of
	the entire system, to be used by the nightly builds

2.1. irafdev based on this change (~ first week of august)

	- will have each package installed separately by shell script

2.2. opus delivery based on this change (~ first week of august)

	- same as irafdev

	- updated opus delivery procedure

	- later deliveries can update each package separately with
	minimal fuss

2.3. developer installs work like the opus installs

	- delete stsci_python/setup.py

2.4. irafx installs based on this change

3. work out how to handle inter-package dependencies

	- how we are going to keep these requires= correct in a
	development environment and how we are going to get them
	right in releases

        - I'm working on a set of version management tools for this purpose,
          as well as generating development snapshots where all the
          versions point to specific SVN revisions trunk trunk (Erik)


4. migrate individual packages to new install

	- happens one at a time, as we get to them

	- uses d2to1, uses requires to specify dependencies (even
	though the stsci_python install ignores this information)

5. procedure for constructing individual package source distributions

	- provides packages requires=

	- this is a formal written procedure; if it is not documented,
	it doesn't exist

6. procedure for assembling individual package source distributions into a single distribution

7. local pypi server

	- not a critical path for nightly builds (pypi is not a helpful
	tool for me -- it is a thing I am compelled to be compatible
	with)

	- http://ssb.stsci.edu switched unauthenticated (https remains authenticated)

	- install pypi server on http://ssb.stsci.edu/pypi

	- procedure for installing source distributions on server
		- development
		- released

8. master setup.py that installs stsci_python using requires=

	- defaults to our pypi server

	- data driven, by same data used in stsci_python/newinstall
		- which data is source and which is object is open
		for discussion

x. figure out what to do on Windows

x. split stsci_python into HST, JWST, and STSCI ?

	- adapt jwst development to this procedure too

x. procedure for installing releases to pypi.python.org
