        Buildout helper recipes
        =======================
        
        This module implements two simple recipes to execute either a `shell` script (actually `batch`
        scripts under M$-Windows) or a Python script.
        
        Both recipes take two options, ``install`` and ``update``: both are considered as a list of
        statements, one per line, that will be written in a temporary file that will be executed
        respectively when the recipe is installed or updated. One or the other may be missing, and in
        such case nothing will happen for that particular step.
        
        When the commands to execute depend on the platform, they can be specified using the options
        ``install-linux`` or ``install-win32`` that have higher priority than the generic form.
        
        Shell scripts
        -------------
        
        The ``metapensiero.recipe.script:shell`` recipe is implemented by the ``ShellScript`` class,
        and can be used in the following way::
        
            [config]
            recipe = metapensiero.recipe.script:shell
            ini = config.ini
            install = ${buildout:bin-directory}/soladmin create-config ${:ini}
        
        As said, some time the commands to execute depend on the particular platform they are run. In
        such cases, you can say::
        
            [config]
            recipe = metapensiero.recipe.script:shell
            ini = config.ini
            install = ${buildout:bin-directory}/soladmin create-config ${:ini}
            install-win32 =
               ${buildout:bin-directory}/soladmin create-config ${:ini}
               echo Configuration created!
               pause
        
        Python scripts
        --------------
        
        The ``metapensiero.recipe.script:python`` recipe is implemented by the ``PythonScript``
        class. It is somewhat more powerful because it can easily access the whole buildout
        configuration.
        
        Consider the following example::
        
            [start_script]
            recipe = metapensiero.recipe.script:python
            install =
              >>> import sys
              >>> from os.path import join
              >>> basedir = buildout['buildout']['directory']
              >>> bindir = buildout['buildout']['bin-directory']
              >>> script = join(basedir, 'sol.bat' if sys.platform=='win32' else 'sol.sh')
              >>> config = join(basedir, buildout['config']['ini'])
              >>> with open(script, 'w') as f:
              >>>   if sys.platform == 'win32':
              >>>     f.write('@echo off\n')
              >>>   f.write('%s %s\n' % (join(bindir, 'solserver'), config))
              >>> installed = script
        
        As you can see, the script can access other section settings thru the ``buildout`` local
        variable, a dictionary that contains the whole buildout configuration. Another local variable
        is ``options``, another dictionary containing the recipe settings.
        
        The script may set the ``installed`` variable, that can be either a simple scalar string value
        or a sequence of strings: it will be used as the result of the recipe, which usually is the
        list of the files/directories installed by the recipe itself that will be deleted whenever the
        recipe is removed from the configuration.
        
        Using eggs
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If the Python script uses additional eggs, they can be specified with the ``eggs`` option, like
        in the following example::
        
            [extjs]
            recipe = metapensiero.recipe.script:python
            eggs = metapensiero.extjs.desktop
            install =
              >>> from metapensiero.extjs.desktop.scripts.extjs_dl import download_and_extract, URL
              >>> download_and_extract(URL)
