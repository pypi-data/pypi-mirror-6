Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.teamwork is an add-on for Plone supporting workspaces with
        associated workgroups of users, managed locally.
        
        There are two native types of workspaces: a project, which is a workspace
        that is considered top-level and serves as a navigation root, and a normal
        workspace, which can be nested within other workspaces, including projects.
