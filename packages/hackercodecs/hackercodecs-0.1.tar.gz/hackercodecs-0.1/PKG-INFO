Description: Hacker Codecs
        =============
        
        This is a set of codecs for decoding and encoing things related to
        hacking and hacking CTFs. Specifically this was designed
        originally around the fact that decode('bin') doesn't exist in the
        standard library and there are times (especially in a CTF) where this
        is extremely convinient.
        
        Later 'morse' was added to easily encode and decode morse code without
        needing to do it (as) manually. 
        
        The 'ascii85' codec was added specifically for PDF parsing in
        forensics challenges. This could be used, for example, with
        python-magic to check if a string inside of a PDF is actually a file
        of a specific type. 
        
        The 'url' and 'entity' codecs were added as a quick way to encode and
        decode data for web hacking. 
        
        'y' is a stripped down 'yenc' as used for NNTP. Headers and footers
        are not included, they will need to be handled elsewhere. 
        
        Other encodings may have been added, a full list is avaliable by reviewing the code. 
        
        As I run across, or am told about other obscure encoding methods I
        will continue to add to this library.
