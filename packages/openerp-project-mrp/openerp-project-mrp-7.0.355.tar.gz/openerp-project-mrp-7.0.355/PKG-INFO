        Automatically creates project tasks from procurement lines.
        ===========================================================
        
        This module will automatically create a new task for each procurement order line
        (e.g. for sale order lines), if the corresponding product meets the following
        characteristics:
        
            * Product Type = Service
            * Procurement Method (Order fulfillment) = MTO (Make to Order)
            * Supply/Procurement Method = Manufacture
        
        If on top of that a projet is specified on the product form (in the Procurement
        tab), then the new task will be created in that specific project. Otherwise, the
        new task will not belong to any project, and may be added to a project manually
        later.
        
        When the project task is completed or cancelled, the workflow of the corresponding
        procurement line is updated accordingly. For example, if this procurement corresponds
        to a sale order line, the sale order line will be considered delivered when the
        task is completed.
