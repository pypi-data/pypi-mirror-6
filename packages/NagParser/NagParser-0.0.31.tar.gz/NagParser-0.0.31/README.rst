Documentation for it can be found at http://nagparser.readthedocs.org/

These scripts were a small subset of a larger project and were originally written to parse Nagios status data and
integrate it into a real time Operations Dashboard. While most of the dashboard is proprietary we've decided to rip out
this parser and offer it to the Nagios community for use in your own projects. Though this was part of a larger project,
and has some rough edges as we refactor it into a stand-alone project, the core code is pretty stable and
in our environment is run a few hundred thousand times a week on a fairly large nagios data set.
