        silva.fanstatic
        ===============
        
        This package provides an integration of `fanstatic`_ into Silva
        3.0. In order to know how to use it, please refer to the `Silva
        developer documentation`_.
        
        Custom injector
        ===============
        
        This package provides a custom fanstatic injector called rules. It
        can be used like this inside the Paster configuration::
        
          injector = rules
          rules =
             if there is <!-- Here goes Fanstatic top CSS -->
             replace with all css resources
        
             if there is <!-- Here goes Fanstatic top JS -->
             replace with all js top resources
        
             if there is <!-- Here goes Fanstatic bottom JS -->
             replace with all js bottom resources
        
             otherwise
             insert before </head>
        
        The rules let you look for specific markup in the generated HTML and
        will insert the resources around them, if present.
        
        
        Additional API
        ==============
        
        This package provides additional objects ``ExternalResources`` and
        ``Snippet`` in order to include external URLs as resources and
        inline snippets too.
