Description: Genome, transcript, and protein sequence variants are typically reported
        using the `mutation nomenclature ("mutnomen") recommendations
        <http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/>`_ provided by the `Human Genome Variation
        Society (HGVS) <http://www.hgvs.org/>`_. This standard was formulated in
        an era of specialized sequencing and cytogenetic analyses, long before
        high-throughput sequencing annotation was envisioned.  Unfortunately, the
        complexity of biological phenomena and the breadth of the standard makes
        it difficult to implement the standard in software.
        
        This package, ``hgvs``, is an easy-to-use Python library for parsing,
        representing, formatting, and mapping variants between genome, transcript,
        and protein sequences.  The current implementation handles most (but not
        all) of the standard for precisely defined sequence variants.  The intent
        is to centralize the subset of HGVS variant manipulation that is routinely
        used in modern, high-throughput sequencing analysis.
