    Use exceptions from common Oslo code
    
    Most of tuskarclient exceptions are similar to exceptions
    from common clients code, so we should use exceptions from
    Oslo to avoid code duplication.

    Fixes in do_flavor_delete() method
    
    Implement parsing of CLI arguments to do_flavor_delete() methods.
    
    Fixed parameters pass to fetch_flavor() - no value passed for parameter
    'flavor_id' in function fetch_flavor() call - added missed parameter.
    Test modified.

    Use Resource() class from common Olso code
    
    Almost all methods from tuskar Resource() are similar to methods
    from common Resource(), so there is a sense to use inheritance to
    remove a duplicate methods from Resource() in tuskarclient.

    Revert "Support building wheels (PEP-427)"
    
    This reverts commit f3d6ec51cf18b6d8f939f5bc0772638949ada032.
    
    The patch being reverted should not have been merged, because
    setting universal to True is used to claim in-place python 2/3
    compatibility in Wheel packages.
    
    We don't support python 3 yet (issues with keystone client), so we
    must not claim the opposite here (as this would harm end users as
    soon as we start uploading Wheel packages to PyPi).
    
    Please see the following links for details:
     - http://pythonwheels.com/
     - http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2013-November/020059.html

    Remove empty CLI source files
    
    A few empty files were added to anchor module structure back when we
    had no CLI implemented. This anchor is no longer needed because we
    already have some CLI subcommands implemented. Now we just keep adding
    empty files for the sake of consistency whenever we implement new
    Python bindings, which causes confusion when doing reviews. We should
    remove the empty files.

    Fix handling of values obtained from Keystone
    
    The auth token and endpoint values obtained from Keystone used to be
    silently ignored, because _get_client_with_token() function referred to
    them using keyword argument names different from ones we called it with.
    
    To fix it, moved `token` and `endpoint` to keyword arguments as
     `os_auth_token` and `tuskar_url` in _get_client_with_credentials().

    Racks CRUD commands
    
    Commands implemented previously and tweaked:
    rack-show
    rack-list
    
    Newly implemented commands:
    rack-create
    rack-update
    rack-delete
    
    We might eventually want to provide a way to set capacities for racks
    and flavors one by one, but after discussing with multiple people we
    still don't have obvious correct way to do this, so i'm leaving it out
    for now and it can be added later. Currently we can set capacities in
    bulk via --capacities.

    CLI still prints that we don't have logging set up (bug 1218261), but
    for resource not found it prints a nice error message instead of a
    stack trace. The root cause of the problem was that we don't have
    finding of resources by name implemented yet.

    Advanced print formatting for CLI
    
    Modelled mostly after how Heat does it, but with some added power and
    also consistency between print_list and print_dict.
    
    We have print_list for printing of lists and print_dict for printing
    of show actions. Both functions take as arguments (aside from the data
    to print) also an optional dict of custom formatters (allowing to
    freely format the attributes before printing) and custom labels
    (allowing to tweak table headers and property names). The list is also
    sorted by one of the columns.
    
    The formatting is showcased on sample formatters and actions -
    rack-show and rack-list.

    Refactors some dict manipulation from test into tests/utils.
    
    Raises ValueError in client/get_client() when kwargs
    do not meet requirements.

    Implement a rough CLI foundation
    
    This is a foundation for CLI work, still has rough spots but works for
    two PoC commands - rack-list and rack-show (communicates with Tuskar,
    prints). There's remaining stuff to be solved:
    
    * Allow arbitrary formatting of attributes (bug #1213056)
    
    * Add help support for subcommands (bug #1213050)
    
    * Allow finding resources by name (bug #1213053)
    
    * Allow auth with pre-existing token and Keystone URL (bug #1213052)
    
    Fixes bug #1211826

    This will setup travis envs to run tox on python 2.7, run pep8 tests and

    Coveralls installed and called only in cover env.
    Removes python version spec from .travis.yml - tox uses its own.

    Set default service type to 'management'
    
    We don't know yet what service type will be used in Keystone to
    identify Tuskar service, but it sure won't be 'metering'. We should
    rather get an unknown service type error than fetch a Ceilometer
    service URL mistakenly.

    Argument parsing and checking - allow token authentication
    
    This expands the argument parser and ensure_auth_info method to
    provide alternative means of authentication. Up to now the CLI
    required username, password, tenant and Keystone URL. Now user can
    also provide auth token and Tuskar URL (alternatively Keystone URL
    instead of Tuskar URL, in that case the Tuskar URL would be fetched
    from Keystone).

    Flavors CRUD
    
    Flavors are a subresource of Resource Class, so there's one more id
    parameter to supply for each operation. Otherwise it works pretty much
    the same as every other resource.
