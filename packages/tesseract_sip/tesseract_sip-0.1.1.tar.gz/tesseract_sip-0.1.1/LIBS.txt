
These instructions are only expected to be required on Windows, though
I haven't tried compiling this wrapper on other platforms yet. 

You should unpack your binary distribution of leptonica and tesseract
to conform with the uniform source tree structure that is expected by
the tesseract/leptonica projects. As a bonus, if you need to compile
tesseract/leptonica by hand, then you won't need to change anything
around to make that work. 

When finished, you should end up with a directory structure that looks 
like this. 

    BuildFolder\
        python-tesseract-sip\
        include\
            leptonica\
            tesseract\
        libs\
        
Tesseract
=========
        
The latest version of the tesseract files can be obtained from

    http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/downloads/list
    
And the file that you're looking for is:

    tesseract-3.02.02-win32-lib-include-dirs.zip
    
Leptonica
=========
    
The latest version of the leptonica files can be obtained from

    http://code.google.com/p/leptonica/downloads/list
    
And the file that you're looking for is:

    leptonica-1.68-win32-lib-include-dirs.zip
