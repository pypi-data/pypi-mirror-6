Description: ======================
        silva.security.addable
        ======================
        
        This small `Silva`_ extension provides an interface in the Silva
        management interface to configure which Silva roles have the
        permission to add which Silva content type.
        
        It is ensuring that the permissions currently set are correct
        according the Silva logic.
        
        It requires at least `Silva`_ 3.0.
