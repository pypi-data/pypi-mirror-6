Description: Supports item (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `unicode`, `datetime`, `none`) and  collection (`list`, `set`, `tuple` and `dict`, as well as iterable and dict-like objects) data types with arbitrary nesting for the collections. Items with a `datetime` type are converted to ISO format strings. Items with a `none` type become empty XML elements.
        
        The root object passed into the `dicttoxml` function can be any of the supported data types.
        
        To satisfy XML syntax, the method wraps all the dict keys/elements and values in a `<root> ... </root>` element. However, this can be disabled to create XML snippets.
        
        For lists of items, if each item is also a collection data type (`lists`, `dict`), the elements of that item are wrapped in a generic `<item> ... </item>` element.
        
        Each elements includes a `type` attribute with the data type. Note: `datetime` data types are converted into ISO format strings, and `unicode` and `datetime` data types get a `str` attribute.
        
            Python -> XML
            integer   int
            float     float
            string    str
            unicode   str
            datetime  str
            None      null
            boolean   bool
            list      list
            set       list
            tuple     list
            dict      dict
        
        Elements with an unsupported data type raise a TypeError exception. 
        
        If an element name is invalid XML, it is rendered with the name "key" and the invalid name is included as a `name` attribute. E.g. `{ "^.{0,256}$": "foo" }` would be rendered `<key name="^.{0,256}$">foo</key>`. An exception is element names with spaces, which are converted to underscores.
        
        **This module should work in Python 2.6+ and Python 3.**
