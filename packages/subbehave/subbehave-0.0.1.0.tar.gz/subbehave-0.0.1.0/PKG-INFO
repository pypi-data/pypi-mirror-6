Description: 
        The Subbehave module exposes `Behave <http://pythonhosted.org/behave/>`_ step outcomes as commands for consumption by another process.
        Additional commands are provided for transitions from feature to scenario and from scenario to step.
        A consumer can provide additional commands for Behave to emit.
        Behave hooks typically emit these commands to alter the state of the consumer.
        A Django-testing consumer, `Djbehave <https://github.com/popham/djbehave>`_, was developed in parallel with this module, and it should serve as a model for additional consumers.
