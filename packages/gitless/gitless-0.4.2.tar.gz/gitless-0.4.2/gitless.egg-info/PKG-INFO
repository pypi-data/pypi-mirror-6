Description: Gitless
        =======
        
        Gitless is an experimental version control system built on top of Git. Many
        people complain that Git is hard to use. We think the problem lies deeper than
        the user interface, in the concepts underlying Git. Gitless is an experiment to
        see what happens if you put a simple veneer on an app that changes the
        underlying concepts. Because Gitless is implemented on top of Git (could be
        considered what Git pros call a 'porcelain' of Git), you can always fall
        back on Git. And of course your coworkers you share a repo with need never know
        that you're not a Git aficionado.

        Install
        -------
        
        Note that the installation **won't interfere** with your Git installation in any
        way, you can keep using Git, and switch between Git and Gitless seamleslly.
        
        You need to have Python and Git installed. If you don't, search for their
        official websites, install them and come back.
        
        The easiest way to install Gitless is using the Python Package Manager `pip`. If
        you don't have `pip`, just search the web for it, and you'll find installation
        instructions on their website. Now, once you have `pip` installed just do:
        
            $> pip install gitless
        
        You should now be able to start executing the `gl` command.
        
        
        
        Contribute
        ----------
        
        We only have two branches, `master` and `develop`. We code in `develop` and
        merge the changes onto `master` when the changes are stable and we're ready to
        cut a new release. So you'll find on `develop` the latest changes.
        
        We follow (to some extent) the [Google Python Style Guide](
            http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html
            "Google Python Style Guide").
        Before contributing, take a few seconds to look at the style guide and the
        Gitless's code so that your edits are consistent with the codebase.
