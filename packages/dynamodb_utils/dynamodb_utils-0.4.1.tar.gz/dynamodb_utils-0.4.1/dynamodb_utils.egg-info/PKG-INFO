Description: dynamodb_utils
        ==============
        
        A toolchain for Amazon's `DynamoDB <http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/>`_ to make
        common operations easier. Currently contains:
        
        * ``dynamodb-dumper`` - backup tables out of DynamoDB with ease.
        * ``dynamodb-loader`` - restore tables dumped by ``dynamodb-dumper`` with ease.
        
        All tools are built to work with both the main DynamoDB service and DynamoDB
        Local so you can test them out, and also move data easily between production
        and your test environment.
        
        Install with::
        
            pip install dynamodb_utils
        
        
        Usage Examples
        --------------
        
        You can get the (hopefully detailed enough) help with e.g.::
        
            dynamodb-dumper --help
        
        To dump a table, with compression::
        
            dynamodb-dumper mytable.name --compress
        
        To dump just a few hash-key values from a table (for example, if you want a
        restricted subset of data for development)::
        
            dynamodb-dumper mytable.name --compress --hash-keys 101 104 404
        
        To load some compressed dump files on a DynamoDB Local instance running locally
        on port 3232::
        
            dynamodb-loader mytable.name --host http://localhost:3232 --region localhost --load mytable.name.*.dump.gz
