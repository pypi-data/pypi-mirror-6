Description: DiscourseGraphs
        ===============
        
        This library enables you to process linguistic corpora with multiple levels
        of annotations by:
        
        1. converting the different annotation formats into separate graphs and 
        2. merging these graphs into a single multidigraph (based on the common
           tokenization of the annotation layers)
        
        So far, the following formats can be imported and merged:
        
        * `TigerXML`_ (a format for representing tree-like syntax graphs with
          secondary edges)
        * RS3 (a format used by `RSTTool`_ to
          annotate documents with Rhetorical Structure Theory)
        * an ad-hoc plain text format for annotating expletives (you're probably not
          interested in)

        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/arne-cl/discoursegraphs.git
            cd discoursegraphs
            python setup.py install # prepend 'sudo' if needed
        
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`_
        - `networkx <http://networkx.github.io/>`_
        
        If you'd like to visualize your graphs, you will also need:
        
        - `graphviz <http://graphviz.org/>`_
        - `pygraphviz <http://pygraphviz.github.io/>`_
