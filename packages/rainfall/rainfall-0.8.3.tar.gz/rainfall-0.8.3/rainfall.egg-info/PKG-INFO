Description: Quickstart
        ====================================
        
        To start off, rainfall is a micro web framework around asyncio (ex tulip), similiar to the cyclone or tornado. Since it is asyncio based, rainfall is fully asyncronous.
        
        The performance tests have shown that rainfall is not slower then twisted+cyclone and sometimes even faster (benchmark results will be posted later or you can test it by yourself).
        
        
        Installation
        ------------------------------------
        
        As simple as::
        
            pip install rainfall
        
        .. note::
            sometimes pip for python 3 is called pip3, but you may have it with other name
        
        
        Hello world
        ------------------------------------
        
        Let's create a simple hello world app in example.py file like this::
        
            import asyncio
            from rainfall.web import Application, HTTPHandler
        
        
            class HelloHandler(HTTPHandler):
                @asyncio.coroutine
                def handle(self, request):
                    return 'Hello!'
        
        
            app = Application(
                {
                    r'^/$': HelloHandler(),
                },
            )
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                app.run()
        
        Now you can run it by::
        
            python3 example.py
        
        And go to http://127.0.0.1:8888 in browser, you should see "Hello!"
