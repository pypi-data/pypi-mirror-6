Description: 
        BVCOPULA
        ========
        
        This module mainly contains routines of probability distribution functions,
        density functions, random sample generating functions, H-functions and Inverse
        H-functions for six bivariate copulas families (will includes BB1, BB6, BB7, BB8
        etc families in future). In this package, we label the ten families with an
        integer as below.
        
                0 ~ Independent
                1 ~ Normal 
                2 ~ Student t 
                3 ~ Clayton
                4 ~ Gumbel
                5 ~ Frank
                6 ~ Joe
                7 ~ BB1 (coming soon)
                8 ~ BB6 (coming soon)
                9 ~ BB7 (coming soon)
               10 ~ BB8 (coming soon)
