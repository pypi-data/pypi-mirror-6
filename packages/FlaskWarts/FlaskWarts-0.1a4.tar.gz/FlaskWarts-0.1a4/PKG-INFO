Description: ===========
        FlaskWarts
        ===========
        
        FlaskWarts are a set of utility classes and functions for making it easier to
        overcome some of the warts that one always seem to encounter when developing
        Flask applications. It's called 'warts' because 'utils' was taken. The main
        package is still called ``utils``, because that's what it was called in a few
        apps author was using the code in, and was too lazy to refactor them all.
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        The library is not too generic. In fact, it's quite opinionated. It's made
        available as is if you care to use it, but it's mainly there for the author's
        use cases.
        
        While not an immediate goal, it is author's intention to make this a
        fully-comliant Flask extension at some point, and far more flexible. It may be
        brokend down into multiple separate libraries as well. Currently, it is a
        multi-purpose library that expects you to organize your site as a single
        application and uses ``flask.current_app`` extensively. While this is not a
        good pattern in general, it's a pattern that works (for the time being).
        
        It also expects that you place your configuration in ``app.config``.
        
        Note that not all code is fully developed and tested. Some of the code even
        misses unit tests, and documentation doesn't exist. So this is pretty much
        pre-alpha software. Also, don't expect anything in the way of API stability in
        any form.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        The utils have following features:
        
        + Class-based route handlers (``utils.routes``)
        + Form-handling with Formencode (``utils.forms``)
        + CSRF middleware (``utils.middlewares``)
        + Basic timezone manipulation support (``utils.timezone``)
        + One decorator for denying non-XHR requests (``utils.decorators``)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Either::
        
            easy_install FlaskWarts
        
        Or::
        
            pip install FlaskWarts
        
        
        Class-based route handling
        ==========================
        
        Please see the sources for now. More detailed docs are planned for future
        releases. It's similar to Django's CBVs but not quite the same.
        
        Form-handling with Formencode
        =============================
        
        Allows basic form validation using Formencode's ``htmlfill_schemabuilder``.
        Docs on the way, so stay tuned.
        
        CSRF middleware
        ===============
        
        A bit rough at the moment, but works. Uses ``os.urandom`` for random number
        generation, you've been warned. It also makes Jinja2 a requirement.
        
        Basic usage is simply::
        
            from utils.middlewares import csrf
            csrf(app)
        
        In template::
        
            <form method="POST">
                {{ csrf_tag }}
                ...
            </form>
        
        Docs? Who said anything about docs? :D
        
        Timezone manipulation
        =====================
        
        Requires pytz_. Again, no docs yet, so please look at the module.
        
        Decorators
        ==========
        
        To prevent non-XHR requests to your endpoint, just do this::
        
            from utils.decorators import xhr_only
        
            @app.route('/')
            @xhr_only
            def my_view():
                pass
        
        It will abort a non-XHR request with HTTP 400 status.
