Description: Welcome to Calflate
        ===================
        
        *Calflate* is a command line application that **conflates** external 
        *CalDAV* and *CardDAV* entries into an other online collection. 
        It does an one-way sync of calendar EVENTs, TODOs, JOURNALs and 
        addressbook entries (VCARD) based on ``UIDs`` and ``SEQUENCE`` or 
        ``REV`` numbers.
        
        *Calflate* is written in Python, it has no dependencies and 
        licenced under the **FreeBSD License**. The source code and 
        issue tracker is available at https://github.com/chripo/calflate.

        the following section for each collection that should be imported.
        
        ::
        
            [COLLECTION-NAME]
            # ignore input argument from command line
            # input = None
            
            # never purge destination items
            # purge = False
            
            # verbose output
            # verbose = True
            
            # don't make changes
            # dryrun = True
            
            # replace UID pattern
            # uid_from = (.+?)@foobar.com
            # uid_to = \1
            
            # source calendar / addressbook
            src = https://source-host.net/test/events.ics/
            # src_user = username
            # src_pass = password
            
            # destination calendar / addressbook
            dst = https://my-server.net/user/calendar.ics/
            dst_user = username
            dst_pass = password
        
        
        **Execute**
        
        - ``calflate --help`` to show usage. 
        - ``calflate COLLECTION-NAME`` to import a specific collection or 
        - ``calflate '*'`` to conflate all sets.
