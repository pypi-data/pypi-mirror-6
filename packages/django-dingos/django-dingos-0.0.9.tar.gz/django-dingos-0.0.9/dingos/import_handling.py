        This is the generic XML import function for dingos. Its parameters

        - xml_fname: Filename of the XML file to be read
        - xml_content: Alternatively, the xml_content can be provided as string
          or as XMLNode (i.e., a piece of XML that has already been parsed)
        - ns_mapping: A dictionary that may already contain mappings of namespaces
          to namespace URIs. Attention: this dictionary will be enriched with namespace
          information found in the XML file!!!
        - embedded_predicate:
          A function that, when given an XML node and a child node, determines whether
          the child node should be treated as separate entity that has been embedded.
          Please refer to existing import modules such as for STIX or OpenIOC for
          examples of how to use this parameter.

        - id_and_revision_extractor:
          A function that, when given an XML node and a child node, determines whether
          this node specifies an identifier and possibly a timestamp.
          Please refer to existing import modules such as for STIX or OpenIOC for
          examples of how to use this parameter.

        - extract_empty_embedded:
          A flag (True/False) governing whether elements that are recognized as
          being embedded but contain no childs should be extracted as separate
          object or not. The default is False; the setting "True" may be necessary
          in cases where there are embedded objects that contain all its information
          in attributes rather than using child elements.

        - keep_attrs_in_created_reference:
          A flag (True/False) governing the shape of the reference created for
          an embedded object: when an embedding is recognized, it is extracted
          and a reference using 'idref' inserted instead. If 'keep_attrs_in_created_reference'
          is True, then the top-level attributes contained in the found embedded object
          are also retained in the reference.


        - transformer:
          A function that, when given an element name and a DingoObjDict containing
          the result of importing the contents under the element of the given name,
          may or may not change the element name and transform the DingoObjDict.
          Please refer to existing import MANTIS modules such as for OpenIOC for
          examples of how to use this parameter.
