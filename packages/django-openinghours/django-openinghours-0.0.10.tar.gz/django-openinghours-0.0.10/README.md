## Usage


### Setup a company
This app supports multiple companies with multiple opening and closing hours. 

### Setting up opening hours
This is used to describe when sth. (eg. the shop) is open. This is done on a daily base (per day) by defining one or more 
start and end times of opening slots.

### Optionally, setting up the closing hour rules

This is used to describe/define when sth. (eg. the shop) is closed (eg. due holiday, 
absences, sickness or whatever). Note that the closing hours overrules the opening hours!



In the index.html (https://github.com/arteria/django-openinghours/blob/master/openinghours/templates/openinghours/index.html) you will find a lot of examples how to use this app.

## Remarks 

* Opening hours is build using datetime's isoweekday. This means Monday is represented by 1 and Sunday by 7.
