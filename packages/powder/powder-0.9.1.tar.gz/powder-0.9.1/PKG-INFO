        Example
        -------
        
        1. Make a new directory and put your pdb file in it.
        2. Make a template settings file in that directory::
        
             powder -t > settings.cfg
        
        3. Edit *at least* the first five values in the settings
           file on the right hand side of the "=" signs.
        
           **Important** - Don't change the names on the left
           of the "=" signs because the left hand side names have meaning.
        
        4. Run *powder* with the config file you edited::
        
             powder settings.cfg
        
        
        Testing Setup
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can test your setup in the test directory with the command::
        
             ./powder-test test.cfg
        
        This allows testing after development without the need to build and install.
        
        The ``-d`` flag is also available to prevent powder from running ccp4 and
        xprepx during debugging.
