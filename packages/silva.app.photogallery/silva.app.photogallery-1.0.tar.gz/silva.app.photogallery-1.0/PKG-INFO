Description: ======================
        silva.app.photogallery
        ======================
        
        ``silva.app.photogallery`` provides an additional view to a folder in
        `Silva`_ 3.0, that is selectable using a customization marker. It will
        display the images inside the folder using a `Gallerific`_
        photogallery.
        
        It is a really simple extension, showing off the customization marker
        feature available in Silva.
