The ZIP Code Finder for Taiwan
==============================

This package lets you find ZIP code by address in Taiwan.

The main features:

1. Fast. It builds ZIP code index by tokenization.
2. Gradual. It returns partial ZIP code rather than noting when address is not
   detailed enoguh.
3. Lightweight. It depends on nothing.

Usage
-----

Find ZIP code gradually:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import zipcodetw
    >>> zipcodetw.find('臺北市')
    '1'
    >>> zipcodetw.find('臺北市信義區')
    '110'
    >>> zipcodetw.find('臺北市信義區市府路')
    '110'
    >>> zipcodetw.find('臺北市信義區市府路1號')
    '11008'

After v0.3, you can find ZIP code fuzzier:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> zipcodetw.find('松山區')
    '105'
    >>> zipcodetw.find('秀山街')
    ''
    >>> zipcodetw.find('台北市秀山街')
    '10042'

Installation
------------

It is available on PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install zipcodetw

Just install it and have fun. :)
