What?
=====

Etcaetera helps you loading your application configuration from multiple sources in a simple way.

It exposes a single **Config** object which you add prioritized sources adapters to (env, files, cmdline, modules...).

Once you call ``load`` method over it: your settings are loaded from your adapters in order, all your configuration is stored in the **Config** object.

You're **done**.



Why?
====

Managing a large application configuration sources can be a pain in the neck.

Command line, files, system environment, modules, a lot of mixed sources can provide you with the settings you seek.

They are all accessed in different ways, and establishing a merging strategy of these differents sources can sometimes look like impossible.

Etcaetera provides you a simple and unified way to handle all the complexity in a single place.

Installation
============

With pip
--------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install etcaetera

With setuptools
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:oleiade/etcaetera
    $ cd etcaetera
    $ python setup.py install


Usage
=====

Dive
----

A real world example worths it all

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from etcaetera.config import Config
    >>> from etcaetera.adapters import Defaults, Overrides, Env, File

    # Let's create a new configuration object
    >>> config = Config()

    # And create a bunch of adapters
    >>> env_adapter = Env(keys=["MY_FIRST_SETTING", "MY_SECOND_SETTING"])
    >>> python_file_adapter = File('/etc/my/python/settings.py')
    >>> json_file_adapter = File('/etc/my_json_settings.json')
    >>> module_adapter = Module(os)
    >>> overrides = Overrides({"MY_FIRST_SETTING": "my forced value"})

    # Let's register them
    >>> config.register([env_adapter, python_file_adapter, json_file_adapter, module_adapter, overrides])

    # Load configuration
    >>> config.load()


    # And that's it
    >>> print config
    {
        "MY_FIRST_SETTING": "my forced value",
        "MY_SECOND_SETTING": "my second value",
        "FIRST_YAML_SETTING": "first yaml setting value found in yaml settings",
        "FIRST_JSON_SETTING": "first json setting value found in json settings",
        ...
    }


Config object
-------------

The config object is the central place for your whole application settings. It will load your adapters
in the order you've registered them, and update itself using it's data.

Please note that **Defaults** adapter will always be loaded first, and **Overrides** will always be loaded last.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from etcaetera.config import Config

    # You can provide defaults to Config at initialization, whether as a Defaults object,
    # or as a dict.
    >>> config = Config({"abc": "123"})

    >>> print config
    {
        "ABC": "123  # every Config keys will be automatically uppercased
    }

    # When you register adapters to it, they are not immediately evaluated.
    >>> config.register(Env(["USER", "PWD"])
    >>> assert "USER" not in config
    True
    >>> assert "PWD" not in config
    True
    >>> config.register(Overrides({"abc": "do re mi"})
    >>> assert config["ABC"] != "do re mi"
    True

    # Whenever you call load, adapters are evaluated and your config
    # values are updated accordingly
    >>> config.load()
    >>> print config
    {
        "ABC": "do re mi",
        "USER": "your user",
        "PWD": "/current/working/directory"
    }


Adapters
--------

Adapters are interfaces to configuration sources. They load settings from their custom source type,
and expose them as a normalized dict to *Config* objects.

Right now, etcaetera provides the following adapters:
    * *Defaults*: sets some default settings
    * *Overrides*: overrides the config settings values
    * *Env*: extracts configuration values from system environment
    * *File*: extracts configuration values from a file. Accepted format are: json, yaml, python module file (see *File adapter* section for more details)
    * *Module*: extracts configuration values from a python module. Like in django, only uppercased variables will be matched

In a close future, etcaetera may provide adapters for:
    * *Argv* argparse format support: would load settings from an argparser parser attributes
    * *File* ini format support: would load settings from an ini file

Defaults adapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defaults adapter provides your configuration object with default values.
It will always be evaluated first when ``Config.load`` method is called.
You can whether provide defaults values to *Config* as a *Defaults* object
or as a dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from etcaetera.adapter import Defaults

    # Defaults adapter provides default configuration settings
    >>> defaults = Defaults({"ABC": "123"})
    >>> config = Config(defaults)

    >>> print config
    {
        "ABC": "123"
    }

Overrides adapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overrides adapter will override *Config* object values with it's own.
It will always be evaluated last when ``Config.load`` method is called.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from etcaetera.adapter import Overrides

    # Overrides adapter helps you setting overriding configuration settings.
    # When registered over a Config objects, it will always be evaluated last.
    # Use it if you wish to force some config values.
    >>> overrides_adapter = Overrides({"USER": "overrided value"})
    >>> config = Config({
        "USER": "default_value",
        "FIRST_SETTING": "first setting value"
    })

    >>> config.register(overrides_default)
    >>> config.load()

    >>> print config
    {
        "USER": "overrided user",
        "FIRST_SETTING": "first setting value"
    }



Env adapter
~~~~~~~~~~~

Env adapter will load settings from your system environement.
It should be provided with a list of keys to fetch. If you don't provide
it yourself, the *Config* object it's registered to will automatically
provide it's own.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from etcaetera.adapter import Env

    # You can provide keys to be fetched by the adapter at construction
    >>> env = Env(keys=["USER", "PATH"])

    # Or whenever you call load over it. They will be merged
    # with those provided at initialization.
    >>> env.load(keys=["PWD"])

    >>> print env.data
    {
        "USER": "user extracted from environment",
        "PATH": "path extracted from environment",
        "PWD": "pwd extracted from environment"
    }

File adapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~

File adapter will load configuration settings from a file.
Supported formats are json, yaml and python module files. Every key-value pairs
stored in the pointed file will be load in the *Config* object it is registered to.


Python module files
```````````````````

Python module files should be in the same format as Django settings files. Only uppercased variables
will be loaded. Any python data structures are allowed to be used.

*Here's an example*

*Given the following settings.py file*

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat /my/settings.py
    FIRST_SETTING = 123
    SECOND_SETTING = "this is the second value"
    THIRD_SETTING = {"easy as": "do re mi"}
    ignored_value = "this will be ignore"

*File adapter output will look like this*:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from etcaetera.adapter import File

    >>> file = File('/my/settings.py')
    >>> file.load()

    >>> print file.data
    {
        "FIRST_SETTING": 123,
        "SECOND_SETTING": "this is the second value",
        "THIRD_SETTING": {"easy as": "do re mi"}
    }

Serialized files (aka json and yaml)
````````````````````````````````````

*Given the following json file content*:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat /my/json/file.json
    {
        "FIRST_SETTING": "first json file extracted setting",
        "SECOND_SETTING": "second json file extracted setting"
    }

*File adapter output will look like this*:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from etcaetera.adapter import File

    # File adapter awaits on a file path at construction.
    # All you've gotta do then, is letting the magic happen
    >>> file = File('/my/json/file.json')
    >>> file.load()

    >>> print file.data
    {
        "FIRST_SETTING": "first json file extracted setting",
        "SECOND_SETTING": "second json file extracted setting"
    }


Module adapter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Module adapter will load settings from a python module. It emulates the django
settings module loading behavior, in that every uppercased locals to the module
will be matched.

**Given a mymodule.settings module looking this**:

.. code-block:: python

    MY_FIRST_SETTING = 123
    MY_SECOND_SETTING = "abc"

**Loaded module data will look like this**:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from etcaetera.adapter import Module

    # Will extract every uppercased local variables of the module
    >>> module = Module(mymodule.settings)
    >>> module.load()

    >>> print module.data
    {
        MY_FIRST_SETTING = 123
        MY_SECOND_SETTING = "abc"
    }
