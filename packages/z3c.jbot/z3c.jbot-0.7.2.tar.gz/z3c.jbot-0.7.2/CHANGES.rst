Changes
=======

0.7.2 (2014-04-22)
------------------

- Fix issue where zope.browserpage.viewpagetemplatefile.ViewPageTemplateFile
  was not using jbot overrides.
  [davisagli]

0.7.1 (2012-01-09)
------------------

- Fixed an issue where multiple registrations against the same layer
  would cause only one registration (decided randomly) to have effect.

  The lookup code now uses the specification resolution order to query
  for override registrations in order of specialization.
  [malthe]

0.7 (2012-01-05)
----------------

- Fixed issue where templates being patched by ``five.pt`` would not
  get properly jbotted.

- Use ``five.pt`` if available. [malthe]

- Fixed an issue where tests would fail on Zope 2.10. [malthe]

0.6.3 (2010-09-07)
------------------

- Fixed compatibility with Plone 3.x. [malthe]

0.6.2 (2010-02-17)
------------------

  any valuable information. [hannosch]

- Prefer zope.site over zope.app.component if it is available. [hannosch]
