Description: pyblock
        =======
        
        `pyblock` is a python module for performing a reblocking analysis on
        serially-correlated data.
        
        The algorithms implemented in `pyblock` are not new; please see the documentation for
        references.
        
        pyblock is compatible with (and tested on!) python 2.7 and python 3.3-3.4 and should work
        on any other version supported by `pandas`.

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Documentation and a simple tutorial can be found in the docs subdirectory and on
        `readthedocs <http://pyblock.readthedocs.org>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        `pyblock` can be used simply by adding to `$PYTHONPATH`.  Alternatively, it can be
        installed using distutils: 
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install pyblock
        
        or from PyPI:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install pyblock
        
        `pyblock` requires numpy and (optionally) pandas and matplotlib.  Please see the
        documentation for more details.
