        Installing
        ----------
        
        Dependencies
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - `Python <http://python.org/>`_ 2.7 or 3.3+ (for Debian/Ubuntu you need to
          install the *python2.7-dev* or *python3.3-dev* package)
        - `python-setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`_
        - hcitool (usually available in the *bluez-utils* or equivalent package)
        
        These packages will normally be installed automatically by the setup script,
        but you may want to use your distro's packages if available:
        
        - `pyudev <http://pyudev.readthedocs.org/>`_ 0.16 or higher
        - `python-evdev <http://pythonhosted.org/evdev/>`_ 0.3.0 or higher
        
        
        Stable release
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Installing the latest release is simple by using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ sudo pip install ds4drv
        
        Development version
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        If you want to try out latest development code check out the source from
        Github and install it with:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/chrippa/ds4drv.git
            $ cd ds4drv
            $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Using
        -----
        
        Raw bluetooth mode
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Prior to bluez 5.14 it was not possible to pair with the DS4. Therefore this
        workaround exists which connects directly to the DS4 when it has been started
        in pairing mode (by holding Share + PS until the LED starts blinking rapidly).
        
        This is the default mode when running without any options:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ ds4drv
        
        
        Hidraw mode
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        This mode supports connecting to already paired bluetooth devices (requires
        bluez 5.14+) and devices connected by USB.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ ds4drv --hidraw
        
        **Note:** Unfortunately due to a kernel bug it is currently not possible to use
        any LED functionality when using bluetooth devices in this mode.
        
        
        Permissions
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ds4drv uses the kernel module *uinput* to create input devices in user land and
        module *hidraw* to communicate with DualShock 4 controllers (when using
        ``--hidraw``), but this usually requires root permissions. You can change the
        permissions by copying the `udev rules file <udev/50-ds4drv.rules>`_ to
        ``/etc/udev/rules.d/``.
        
        You may have to reload your udev rules after this with:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
            $ sudo udevadm trigger
        
        
        Configuring
        -----------
        
        Configuration file
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The preferred way of configuring ds4drv is via a config file.
        Take a look at `ds4drv.conf <ds4drv.conf>`_ for example usage.
        
        ds4drv will look for the config file in the following paths:
        
        - ``~/.config/ds4drv.conf``
        - ``/etc/ds4drv.conf``
        
        ... or you can specify your own location with ``--config``.
        
        
        Command line options
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        You can also configure using command line options, this will set the LED
        to a bright red:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ ds4drv --led ff0000
        
        See ``ds4drv --help`` for a list of all the options.
        
        
        Multiple controllers
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ds4drv does in theory support multiple controllers (I only have one
        controller myself, so this is untested). You can give each controller
        different options like this:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ ds4drv --led ff0000 --next-controller --led 00ff00
        
        This will set the LED color to red on the first controller connected and
        green on the second.
        
        
        Known issues/limitations
        ------------------------
        
        - Bluetooth 2.0 dongles are known to have issues, 2.1+ is recommended.
        - The controller will never be shut off, you need to do this manually by
          holding the PS button until the controller shuts off
        - No rumble support
        
        
        References
        ----------
        
        The DualShock 4 report format is not open and had to be reverse engineered.
        These resources have been very helpful when creating ds4drv:

          instead of relying on reports arriving at a constant rate.

        - Fixed crash when hcitool returns non-ascii data.
