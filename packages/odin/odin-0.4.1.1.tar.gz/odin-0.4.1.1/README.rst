Based off a previous library for mapping JSON to python objects Odin branches from just supporting JSON to supporting
many other data representations, allowing them to be mapped into converted into a Python object graph, validated against
a set of validators and mapped into other formats.

* Complete documentation (around 70-80% complete for current features)
* Support for CSV

**Planning**

* Integration with other libraries (ie `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ Models/Forms)

**Optional**

* simplejson - Odin will use simplejson if it is available or fallback to the builtin json library

**Contrib**

* jinja2 >= 2.7 - For documentation generation

Example
*******

**With definition:**
::

    import odin

    class Author(odin.Resource):
        name = odin.StringField()

    class Publisher(odin.Resource):
        name = odin.StringField()

    class Book(odin.Resource):
        title = odin.StringField()
        authors = odin.ArrayOf(Author)
        publisher = odin.DictAs(Publisher)
        genre = odin.StringField()
        num_pages = odin.IntegerField()

::

    >>> b = Book(
            title="Consider Phlebas",
            genre="Space Opera",
            publisher=Publisher(name="Macmillan"),
            num_pages=471
        )
    >>> b.authors.append(Author(name="Iain M. Banks"))
    >>> from odin.codecs import json_codec
    >>> json_codec.dumps(b, pretty_print=True)
    {
        "$": "Book",
        "authors": [
            {
                "$": "Author",
                "name": "Iain M. Banks"
            }
        ],
        "genre": "Space Opera",
        "num_pages": 471,
        "publisher": {
            "$": "Publisher",
            "name": "Macmillan"
        },
        "title": "Consider Phlebas"
    }


Special Mention
***************

I would like to acknowledge the strong influence on the design of Odin from the Django ORM and it's notable contributor
Malcolm Tredinnick. He was a valued colleague who's untimely passing left a large void in our company and the wider
community.
