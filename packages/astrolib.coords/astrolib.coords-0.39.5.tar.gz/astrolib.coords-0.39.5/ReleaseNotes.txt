Version 0.37 adds the leap second for dates after 1 Jan 2009.

------------------------------------------------------------
Prior release notes are included below
------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.36 is a bugfix build:

  - Some not-really-extraneous declarations were restored to
  misc.h. Thanks to Dr. Jae-Joon Lee for submitting the patch.


Version 0.35 converts to numpy and cleans up some build issues.

The following changes have been made:
  - Coords now uses numpy instead of numarray. Associated
  documentation has been changed.
  - Extraneous declarations were stripped from the misc.h file, which
  were causing build problems on Fedora 7.
  - Unused variables were stripped from src/blackbox.c and most files
  in src/tpm.
  - Files in src/tpm now include. the Subversion $Id$ keyword expansion.
  

Version 0.3 expands support for time specification in AstroDate and Position.

The following changes have been made:
   - timetag specification is now supported for TPM-related methods of
   Position objects. (See "An explanatory note about time", in the
   v0.25 release notes below, for more discussion.)

   - the AstroDate factory function was enhanced to accept a
   datetime.datetime object (assumed to be in UTC) as a time
   specification, and to produce a JulianDate of "utc now" when no
   argument is supplied.

   - tests were refactored; coords._test() now runs a doctest that
   matches the set of (now expanded) examples given to demonstrate
   package functionality. Unit tests were removed from the
   distribution and documentation. The package import statements were
   also trimmed down to avoid unnecessarily cluttering the namespace.

------------------------------------------------------------
 
Version 0.25 is a bugfix release of the coords package.

The following issues have been addressed:
    - Negative degrees in sexagesimal specification is now handled
    - Longitude/RA convention for TPM-based method calls is now
    consistent with the rest of the package
    - Example text has been updated



An explanatory note about time:

There are three times of interest associated with a celestial
coordinate. TPM calls these
- the equinox == time at which precession is zero
- the epoch == time at which proper motion is zero
- the timetag of the coordinate 

At present (v0.25), the Coords package enforces equinox=B1950 for
galactic coordinates and J1984 for ecliptic coordinates; celestial
coordinates may be specified at J2000 or B1950, or at an arbitary
Julian (decimal) year. For all coordinate systems, it enforces 
epoch=J2000 and timetag="time now" -- that is, it uses the current 
system time. 

Galactic and celestial coordinate systems are very insensitive to
changes in "time now", but due to the nature of the ecliptic reference
frame, ecliptic coordinates are quite sensitive. 

The v0.3 release of the Coords package is planned to include the
ability to specify the timetag of the coordinate.
