Description: Flask-Velox
        ===========
        
        ``Flask-Velox`` is a Flask extension designed to provide ready made View and
        Mixin  classes to help rapidly build Flask applications for both public and
        admin systems, based on Flasks pluggable ``MethodView``.
        
        Here at `SOON_`_ we use Flask a lot and we wanted a framework we could use
        across all our products. As our products and requirements grow so
        will ``Flask-Velox``. It is early days but the absolute
        basics are there and we would love feedback and help to grow this further.
