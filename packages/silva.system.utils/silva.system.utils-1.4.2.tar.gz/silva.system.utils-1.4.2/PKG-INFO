        Introduction
        ============
        
        This extension provides a script to help you manage `Silva`_ sites in
        the Zope instance from the command line. This will add script into the
        ``bin`` directory of your installation called ``silva``.
        
        For most of the operations, the script requires you to provide the
        Zope 2 configuration file with the option ``-c``.
        
        By default you can , view the Silva site in the root of your database,
        create and delete Silva sites, and users to them, pack your database,
        and remove old versions of versioned content.
        
        The script is however pluggable. An another default command provided
        by ``silva.core.upgrade`` extension let you to upgrade a Silva site.
