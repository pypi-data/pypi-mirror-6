        Material required
        =================
        
        This program is designed to work with :
            * a portable computer (Raspberry Pi ideally)
            * an Arduino
            * (optionnally) an Adafruit CharLCDPlate (you might want to change the code if you consider not using it)
            * a LAN to view the graph
        
        Software requirements
        =====================
        
            * pygal
            * pyfirmata
            * pyserial
            * GNU/Linux or UNIX/\*BSD on your portable computer
        
        What it is for
        ==============
        
        It reads datas, processes it and displays it in a nice graph.
        Datas are read from the Arduino then transmitted to the computer,
        processed and eventually diplayed in a nice graph available via
        a network browser.
        Developped for a project for the Baccalaur√©at exam.
        
Platform: GNU/Linux
