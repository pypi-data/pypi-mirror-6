Description: *opc-diag* is a command-line application for exploring Microsoft Word, Excel,
        and PowerPoint files from Office 2007 and later. Also known as *Office Open
        XML*, the structure of these files adheres to the Open Packaging Convention
        (OPC), specified by ISO/IEC 29500.
        
        *opc-diag* provides the ``opc`` command, which allows OPC files to be browsed,
        diff-ed, extracted, repackaged, and parts from one to be substituted into
        another.
        
        Its primary use is by developers of software that generates and/or
        manipulates Microsoft Office documents.
        
        A typical use would be diff-ing a Word file from before and after an operation,
        say inserting a paragraph, to identify the specific changes Word made to the
        XML. This is handy when one is developing software to do the same without
        Word's help::
        
           $ opc diff before.docx after.docx
        
        Another main use is to diagnose an issue causing an Office document to not load
        cleanly, typically because the software that generated it has a bug. These
        problems can be tedious and often difficult to diagnose without tools like
        *opc-diag*, and were the primary motivation for developing it.
