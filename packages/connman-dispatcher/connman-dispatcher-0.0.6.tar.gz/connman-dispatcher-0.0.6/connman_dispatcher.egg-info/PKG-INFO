Description: # Description
        
        Run scripts on network state changes
        
        # Install
        
            pip install connman-dispatcher [--user]
        
        
        # Usage
        
            $ connman-dispatcher -h
            usage: connman-dispatcher [-h] -p PATH
        
        Scripts are run from folders setted in -p argument
        One can set more than one folder.
        
        When network state changes, each script is executed with either 'up' or 'down'
        argument, depening on the current network state.
        
        For example, if connman-dispatcher was run like this:
        
            connman-dispatcher -p /etc/connman-dispatcher
        
        And we have some scripts in bash in this folder, something like:
        
        ```bash
        up() {
        # handle up state
        }
        
        down() {
        # handle down state
        }
        
        state="$1"
        
        case $state in
            up)
                up
                ;;
            down)
                down
                ;;
        esac
        ```
        
        When network state changes from 'down' to 'up', each script in '/etc/connman-dispatcher'
        will be executed with 'up' argument, like this:
        
            /etc/connman-dispatcher/10_handle_network_state_change.sh up
            /etc/connman-dispatcher/some_other_executable up
        
        
        Scripts, as well as script folders are sorted by name.
