SpringField makes API data easy.

SpringField makes it simple to model structured data. Once the data is modeled,
SpringField can parse API responses into easy to use Python objects and types. It
can also generate the same structured data for making API request.

SpringField is ideal for:

- Restful JSON API data structures
- Parsing CSV data structures from ``csv.DictReader``
- Turning anything Python can parse into a ``dict`` or ``list`` into a structured object
