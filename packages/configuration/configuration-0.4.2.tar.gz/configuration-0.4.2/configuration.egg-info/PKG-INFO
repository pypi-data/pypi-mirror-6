Description: configuration
        =============
        
        multi-level unified configuration for python consumption
        
         - you have a (python) program that wants to read configuration from
           configuration files (I currently support JSON and YAML) and also
           from the command line [TODO: environment variables]
        
         - you want to be able to serialize and deserialize configuration
        
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        The ``configuration.Configuration`` class is an abstract base
        class that extends ``optparse.OptionParser``.  The form of the
        configuration is dictated by setting the ``options`` attribute on your
        subclass.  ``options`` is a dictionary of the form::
        
          {'name': {<value>}}
        
        ``name`` is the name of the configuration option, and ``value`` is a
        ``dict`` that gives the form of the option.
        
        ``Configuration`` transforms these options into ``OptionParser`` options.
        
        Options for ``value`` include:
        
         * help : what the option is about (translated to command line help)
         * default: default value for the option
         * required: if a true value, this option must be present in the
           configuration. If ``required`` is a string, it will be displayed if
           the option is not present. If the default is defined, you won't
           need required as the default value will be used
         * type: type of the option. Used to control the parsing of the option
         * flags: a list that, if present, will be used for the command line
           flags. Othwise, the option name prepended by ``--`` will be used.
           To disable as a command line option, use an empty list ``[]``
        
        In addition, you may extend ``Configuration`` and have additional
        useful items in the ``value`` dict for ``options``.
        
        For an example, see
        http://k0s.org/mozilla/hg/configuration/file/c831eb58fb52/tests/example.py#l7
        
        
        Configuration Files
        -------------------
        
        Config files are useful for (IMHO) A. complicated setup;
        B. reproducibility; C. being able to share run time configurations.
        The latter is mostly useful if the configuration contains nothing
        machine-specific (e.g. the path to an executable might vary from
        machine to machine) or if the configuration is overridable from the
        command line.
        
        ``configuration`` features the ability to serialize (dump) and deserialize
        (load) configuration from a pluggable set of formats.  By default,
        ``--dump <filename>`` will dump the resultant configuration (that
        gathered from the command line options and loaded configuration files)
        to a file of format dictate by the file extension (Example:
        ``--dump mydumpfile.json`` will use JSON format).  The flag for the
        option, e.g. ``--dump``, may be set via the ``dump`` parameter to
        ``Configuration``'s constructor.
        
        ``Configuration`` instances can also deserialize data.  The normal case of
        using configuration is when you want to be able to read from
        configuration files.  By default, ``Configuration`` instances read
        positional arguments for configuration files to be loaded.  If you
        specify a ``load`` argument to the ``Configuration`` constructor, this
        option will be used instead.  Likewise, the file extension will be
        used to determine the format.
        
        The `configuration package <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/configuration>`_
        requires ``json``(``simplejson`` on older python) and ``PyYAML`` so
        these serializers/deserializers are available if you install the package.
        
        
        Extending Configuration
        -----------------------
        
        ``configuration`` is designed to be pluggable.  While you get a useful
        set of behaviour out of the box, most of the handlers for
        ``configuration`` may be manipulated to do what you want to do.
        
        ``Configuration``'s constructor takes an argument, ``types``, which is
        a dictionary of callables keyed on type that translate
        ``Configuration.options`` into ``optparse`` options.  If one of
        ``Configuration.options`` type isn't specified (or is ``None``), then
        the default is used (``configuration.base_cli`` unless you override this).
        If not passed, a ``Configuration`` instance uses ``configuration.types``.
        
        The callables in ``types`` should take the option name and value
        dictionary and should return the args and keyword args necessary to
        instantiate an ``optparse.Option``.
        
        ``Configuration``'s constructor also accepts an option,
        ``configuration_providers``, that is a list of
        serializers/deserializers to use.  These should be objects with a list
        of ``extensions`` to use, a ``read(filename)`` method that will load
        configuration, and a ``write(config, filename)`` method to write it.
        ``read`` should return the read configuration.
        If ``write`` is not present the provider cannot serialize.
