        ## Examples
        `gett` displays a helpful help text when run with the `-h` flag.
        ``` 
        $ gett
        usage: gett.py [-h] [-s share_id] [-t share_title] [-i share_id]
                       [-d share_id [share_id ...]] [-l] [-r file_url [file_url ...]]
                       [-q]
                       [files [files ...]]
        
        Upload files to ge.tt via the command line
        ```
        
        Command Examples - 
        ```
        $ gett                            # show help
        $ gett file1 file2 file3          # upload files (in same share)
        $ gett *.py                       # linux globs (upload)
        $ gett *.py -s sharename          # upload file in the specific share
        $ gett *.py -s sharename -t title # gives the title to the new share
        $ gett --list                     # show list of shares
        $ gett -d share1 share2 share3    # deletes the shares
        $ gett -r url1 url2 url 3         # deletes the file url
        $ gett -q {etc}                   # quiet mode
        $ gett -i sharename               # get share info
        ```
        
        To upload a file, use the -u flag. By default, `gett` will create a new share for uploading the file. Use the -s flag, alongwith a sharename to upload to an existing share
        ```
        $ gett something.txt
        Constructing a new share ...
        Setting up a file name ...
        Uploading the file...
        Upload successful. Here's your url: http://ge.tt/1NcgabB1/v/0
        ----------------------------------------
        
        $ gett something.txt -s 5d1ctaB1
        Setting up a file name ...
        Uploading the file...
        Upload successful. Here's your url: http://ge.tt/5d1ctaB1/v/1
        ```
        
        To delete a share use the -d flag. To get more info about a share, use the -s flag accompanied by a sharename.
        ```
        $ gett -d 1NcgabB1
        Destroying share ...
        1NcgabB1 share has been destroyed
        
        $ gett -r http://ge.tt/6zkcEkB1/v/0
        Deleting file ...
        File has been successfully destroyed
        ```
