Version 1.1.1 - 2013-12-22
============================
Fixed a tiny typo that would not cause problems particularly, 
but needed to be fixed --- code would not import gvar from lsqfit
even if it was present.

Also made the slower examples run faster, so you don't have 
to wait so long. Added a plot to the path-integral example to 
compare the lattice path-integral result with the exact result
(provided matplotlib installed).

Version 1.1 - 2013-12-22
=========================

Original release made use of the lsqfit package in the testing. This package
is quite useful in conjunction with vegas (for the gvar module) but it is not
required. The testing and examples now work without  lsqfit present, which was
the original intent. See discussion at the  end of the Tutorial about the role
of lsqfit. 

Version 1.0 - 2013-12-21
==========================
This is the first version of a new implementation
of the vegas algorithm for adaptive multidimensional
Monte Carlo integration. It is written in Python/Cython
and features a significantly improved algorithm
relative to earlier versions of vegas. In particular
it now uses two adaptive strategies instead of one.
