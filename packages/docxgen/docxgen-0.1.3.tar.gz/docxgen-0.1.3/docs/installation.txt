Installation
============

docxgen requires python 2.6 and above to work correctly. It also works with
python 3.2 or 3.3 thanks to the six_ compatibility layer.

Installing a released version
-----------------------------

You can install the most recent docxgen version using `easy_install`_::

    sudo easy_install docxgen

Or you can also use pip::

    sudo pip install docxgen

Either way we strongly recommend using these tools in combination with
`virtualenv`_.

This will install a docxgen egg in your Python installation's `site-packages`
directory.

Alternatively you can install from the release tarball:

1.  Download the most recent tarball from the `download page`_.
2.  Unpack the tarball.
3.  ``sudo python setup.py install``

Note that the last command will automatically download and install
`setuptools`_ if you don't already have it installed.  This requires a working
Internet connection.

This will install docxgen into your Python installation's `site-packages`
directory.


Installing the development version
----------------------------------

If you prefer to live on the edge, be my guest.

1.  Install `Git`_
2.  ``git clone git://github.com/kunxi/docxgen.git``
3.  ``cd docxgen``
4.  ``sudo python setup.py install``
