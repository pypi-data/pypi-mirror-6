# trapperkeeper

### Description
TrapperKeeper is an SNMP trap daemon for ingesting and exposing traps. _This is a
work in progress and not ready for general consumption._

### Installation

New versions will be updated to PyPI pretty regularly so it should be as easy
as:

```bash
pip install trapperkeeper
```
