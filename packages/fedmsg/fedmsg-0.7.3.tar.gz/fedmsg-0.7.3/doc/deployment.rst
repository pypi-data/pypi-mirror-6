Deployment

This document isn't yet written.  If you have questions about deployment, please
come and ask in ``#fedora-apps`` on freenode or on the `mailing list
<https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/messaging-sig>`_.

We have fedmsg successfully deployed (and growing) in `Fedora Infrastructure
<https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/>`_.  The code should be generic
enough to run in other environments.  If you come and ask, we'll write the docs.
