Table conversion/export widget
==============================

The only widget in this category, :ref:`Convert`, takes *Table* data
in input and emits *ExampleTable* data for further processing with Orange
Canvas. It also makes it possible to apply various standard transforms to a
table, such as sorting, normalizing, etc., as well as to export its contents
to a file.
