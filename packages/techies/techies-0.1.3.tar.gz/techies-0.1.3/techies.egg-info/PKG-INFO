        Opinionated Python toolbox
        
        Master branch: |Build Status|
        
        List of Tools
        -------------
        
        ``Queue`` Implementations (backed by Redis)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. ``techies.Queue``, based on Redis List. Interfaces are almost
           standard queue compatible.
        2. ``techies.UniQueue``, based on Redis Sorted Set. Inherits
           ``techies.Queue`` but ignores repetitive items, keeps items unique.
           Score of the sorted set member is epoch timestamp from
           ``time.time()``.
        3. ``techies.CountQueue``, based on Redis Sorted Set. Inherits
           ``techies.UniQueue`` but score is used as a count of item appearance,
           that the item has the highest count gets placed in front to be
           ``get`` first.
        
        ``logging.Handler`` Implementation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. ``techies.QueueHandler``, inherits standard ``logging.Handler`` that
           ``emit`` to any standard ``Queue`` compatible implementations,
           including all the ``Queue`` implementations in this library.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        -  Redis server for ``Queue`` implementations
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install techies
            $ pip install techies --upgrade  # to update

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.1.3 (2014-01-20)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Added ``QueueHandler``, inherits standard ``logging.Handler`` that
           ``emit`` to any standard ``Queue`` compatible implementations,
           including all the ``Queue`` implementations in this library
        -  Exposed direct accessibility of all intended APIs, for example,
           ``from techies import Queue``; or if you will,
           ``from techies import *``
        -  Behavior of ``CountQueue.get`` has changed from just returning the
           item value to a ``tuple`` of item value and its number of appearances
           in the queue, eg: ``('dota', 2)``; an empty ``tuple`` is returned
           when the ``CountQueue`` is empty
        
        0.1.2 (2014-01-17)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Added ``CountQueue``, inherits ``UniQueue`` but the score is used as
           a count of item appearance, that the item has the highest count gets
           placed in front to be ``get`` first
        -  Behavior of all ``Queue`` and its subclasses' ``put`` and
           ``put_nowait`` methods changed from return certain value to not
           return anything (more Python standard Queue like)
        
        0.1.1 (2014-01-16)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Python 3.2 and 3.3 supported now
        -  Behavior of both ``Queue`` and ``UniQueue``'s ``get`` method changed
           from returning ``None`` to empty "native string" (unicode for Python
           2.x, str for Python 3.x) when attempting to dequeue from an empty
           queue
        
        0.1.0 (2014-01-16)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Initial release with Redis backed ``Queue`` and ``UniQueue``
