        How to use
        =============
        
        Single Query - BQJob
        ---------------------
        | BQJob is a class for starting the BigQuery job and fetching the result.
        | You can use either run\_sync(synchronous) or run\_async(asynchronous) method.
        
        ::
        
            from bqlib import BQJob
        
            project_id = 'example_project'
            query = 'SELECT foo FROM bar'
            http = authorized_http
        
            bqjob = BQJob(http, project_id, query=query)
        
            # run synchronously
            job_result = bqjob.run_sync()
        
            # or run asynchronously
            bqjob.run_async()
            # ... do other things ...
        
            job_result = bqjob.get_result()
        
            print job_result # [{u'foo': 10}, {u'foo': 20}, ...]
        
        Multiple Queries - BQJobGroup
        --------------------------------
        | BQJobGroup is a class for putting multiple BQJobs into an one group.  
        | Each BQJob in that group are executed concurrently.
        
        ::
        
            from bqlib import BQJob, BQJobGroup
        
            bqjob1 = BQJob(http, project_id, query=query)
            bqjob2 = BQJob(http, project_id, query=query)
        
            job_group = BQJobGroup([bqjob1, bqjob2])
            # synchronously
            results = job_group.run_sync()
        
            # or asynchronously
            job_group.run_async()
            # ... do other things ...
        
            results = job_group.get_results()
        
            print results # [[{'foo': 10}, {'foo': 20}], [{'bar': 'test'}]]

        Note
        =====
        * Concurrent Requests to BigQUery
            * Concurrent requests to BigQuery is restricted to 20 requests by `Quota Policy <https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/quota-policy>`_.
            * If you want to set up concurrent requests to 20, you also have to set up at traffic controls in `api-console <https://code.google.com/apis/console/>`_ page.
