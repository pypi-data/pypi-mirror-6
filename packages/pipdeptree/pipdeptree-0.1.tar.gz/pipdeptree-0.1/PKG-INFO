        ==========
        
        ``pipdeptree`` is a command line utility for displaying the python
        packages installed in an environment in form of a dependency
        tree. Since ``pip freeze`` shows all dependencies as a flat list,
        finding out which are the top level packages and which packages do
        they depend on requires some effort. This utility tries to solve this
        problem.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install pipdeptree
        
        
        Usage and examples
        ------------------
        
        To give you a brief idea, here is the output of ``pipdeptree``
        compared with ``pip freeze``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip freeze
            Flask==0.10.1
            Flask-Script==0.6.6
            Jinja2==2.7.2
            Mako==0.9.1
            MarkupSafe==0.18
            SQLAlchemy==0.9.1
            Werkzeug==0.9.4
            alembic==0.6.2
            argparse==1.2.1
            itsdangerous==0.23
            psycopg2==2.5.2
            redis==2.9.1
            slugify==0.0.1
            wsgiref==0.1.2
        
        And now see what ``pipdeptree`` outputs,
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pipdeptree
            wsgiref==0.1.2
            argparse==1.2.1
            psycopg2==2.5.2
            Flask-Script==0.6.6
              - Flask [installed: 0.10.1]
                - Werkzeug [required: >=0.7, installed: 0.9.4]
                - Jinja2 [required: >=2.4, installed: 2.7.2]
                  - markupsafe [installed: 0.18]
                - itsdangerous [required: >=0.21, installed: 0.23]
            alembic==0.6.2
              - SQLAlchemy [required: >=0.7.3, installed: 0.9.1]
              - Mako [installed: 0.9.1]
                - MarkupSafe [required: >=0.9.2, installed: 0.18]
            slugify==0.0.1
            redis==2.9.1
        
        
        If you wish to track only the top level packages in your
        ``requirements.txt`` file, you could use grep as follows,
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pipdeptree | grep -P '^[\w0-9\-=.]+'
            wsgiref==0.1.2
            argparse==1.2.1
            psycopg2==2.5.2
            Flask-Script==0.6.6
            alembic==0.6.2
            slugify==0.0.1
            redis==2.9.1
            
            $ pipdeptree | grep -P '^[\w0-9\-=.]+' > requirements.txt
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pipdeptree -h
            usage: pipdeptree [-h] [-a] [-l]
        
            Dependency tree of the installed python packages
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help        show this help message and exit
              -a, --all         list all deps at top level
              -l, --local-only  list only the installations local to the current
                                virtualenv, if in a virtualenv
        
        
        Known Issues
        ------------
        
        One thing you might have noticed already is that ``flask`` is shown as
        a dependency of ``flask-script``, which although correct, sounds a bit
        odd. ``flask-script`` is being used here *because* we are using
        ``flask`` and not the other way around. Same with ``sqlalchemy`` and
        ``alembic``.  I haven't yet thought about a possible solution to this!
        (May be if libs that are "extensions" could be distinguished from the
        ones that are "dependencies". Suggestions are welcome.)
