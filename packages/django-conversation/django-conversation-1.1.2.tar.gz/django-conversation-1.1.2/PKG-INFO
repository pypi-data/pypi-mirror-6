        ===================
        
        A reusable Django app that provides threaded conversations between users.

            INSTALLED_APPS = (

            )
        
        Add the ``conversation`` URLs to your ``urls.py``
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                ...
                url(r'^conversation/', include('conversation.urls')),
            )

        Usage
        -----
        
        The conversations in this app are threaded, that means a conversation is
        related to one object. In this case the object is a user. So if ``user1``
        starts a conversation with ``user2`` all messages between those users are
        stored in one conversation (you know it, if your are e.g. a Facebook user).
        
        This app allows another relation, so you can also add a content object to a
        conversation between two users. Let's say you built a sports app. ``user1``
        wants to talk with ``user2`` about a fight called ``Klitschko vs. Tyson``. They
        can now start a conversation, which is also related to that fight. But, they
        can also start a new conversation about other fights or talk to each other
        without another relation, for sure.
        
        If you have executed the tasks written above, the app is ready to work.
        Note: The templates are based on Twitter Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/).
        If you don't use it, simply overwrite them.
        
        In almost every case you want to customize stuff, add jQuery/JavaScript, add
        CSS, your own templates and so on, so this app is kept very simple.
