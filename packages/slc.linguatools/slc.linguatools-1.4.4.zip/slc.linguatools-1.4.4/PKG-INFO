        Plone 4 is supported starting with version 1.4.0 - Bugfix releases for Plone
        3 will be continued in the 1.3.x series.
        
        
        Overview
        ********
        
        slc.linguatools offers a set of functions that are designed to make life easier
        when dealing with multilingual sites, especially those with several different languages.
        
        Often you have the requirement that you want to do the same action for all
        translations of an object. In a site with ten, twenty or more languages, doing
        this manually is not an option any more.
        
        Functions
        =========
        
        slc.linguatools offers assistance for the following use cases:
        
        * Set title or description: 
            Set the title / description on all translations;
            either directly to the string you entered, or based on an i18n label and
            domain
        
        * Rename an object
            Rename all translations to the id (short name) you entered
        
        * Set portlets 
            Propagate the portlet settings of the canonical object to all
            translations, either for all slots or the one you chose. Block / unblock
            portlet inheritance per slot.
        
        * Workflow
            Publish / retract / etc. all translations
        
        * Catalog reindex
            Reindex all translations of an object
        
        * Deleter
            Delete all translations of an object
        
        * Cut and paste
           Cut all translations of an object and paste them to another folder
        
        * Property handling
            Set a property with id, type and value on all translations.
            Example: Set string property "layout" to "@@my-shiny-view". Delete an
            existing property.
        
        * Marker interfaces
            Set or remove a marker interface on all translations of an object. The
            interfaces available for setting and removing are provided by a vocabulary
            and are the same as on the "Interfaces" tab in the ZMI.
        
        * Subtyping (if p4a.subtyper is installed)
            Set a subtype on all translations; remove a subtype
        
        * Translate an object
            Create a translation of the current object for all available languages.
            The AT attributes that should be copied over can be selected. If the object
            is a Collection, then all criteria are copied as well.
        
        * Copy the values of individual fields
            Using the "Translate this object" function mentioned above and selecting the
            "Translation exists" option, you can copy the values of individual AT fields
            to all translations, such as dates, tags (Subject) and Collection criteria.
        
        
        Requirements and Installation
        =============================
        
        This package only works and makes sense if you have LinguaPlone installed.
        
        Add "slc.linguatools" to the eggs and zcml sections of your buildout
        configuration. After running buildout and restarting your instance, go to the
        Site Setup -> Add-on Products, choose slc.linguatools and click "install".
        
        A tab named "Lingua Tools" will then appear on all translatable objects.
        
        Enabling support for language neutral folders in TinyMCE
        --------------------------------------------------------
        
        If you have the default language folder structure (e.g. created by LinguaPlone's
        @@language-setup-folders), you will have a top-level folder that provides
        INavigationRoot for every language in your site (/en, /de, /fr, etc.). In this case
        it will not be possible to have a common language-neutral
        folder (e.g. for images) that is accessible in TinyMCE. For details see:
        http://plone.org/products/linguaplone/issues/275
        
        In this same ticket, a patch to the getBreadcrumbs method of TinyMCE was 
        provided by Robert Niederreiter. This patch is included in slc.linguatools,
        but not activated by default. To activate it, you need to set an environment
        variable called PATCH_TINYMCE_BREADCRUMBS.
        
        You can do this by adding the following to your zope.conf::
        
           <environment>
           PATCH_TINYMCE_BREADCRUMBS true
           </environment>
        
        If you use Buildout, you don't want to edit zope.conf directly, since it will
        be overwritten by the next buildout. Rather, edit your buildout configuration
        and add the following to the [instance] section::
        
          zope-conf-additional =
            <environment>
              PATCH_TINYMCE_BREADCRUMBS true
            </environment>
        
        
        
        Versions
        ========
        
        The first version of this tool featured a manually written BrowserView. During
        the Plone-Conference 2009 sprint, a second version that uses z3c form was
        written. This is the version visible by default via the "Lingua Tools" tab. The
        original version is still accessible under @@linguatools-old.
        
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Please also see test/lttest.txt for a doctest that guides you through the basic
        functionalities.

        1.3.6 (2010-07-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix in PropertyForm: encode unicode to utf-8, otherwise setting the
          property default_page breaks [thomasw]
        - allow module utils for import in python scripts [pilz]
        
        1.3.5 (2010-03-31)
        ------------------
        
        - In plone.z3cform version 0.5.8 a major change was introduced that affects our
          product. By overwriting update() and contents() of FormWrapper, we enable
          support for versions >=0.5.8; with an ugly hack in contents(), we maintain
          support for versions <=0.5.7 [thomasw]

          private [thomasw]
        
        1.3.3 (2010-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Reworked workflow handling. Instead of only "publish", now all transactions
          available on the current object can be triggered [thomasw]
        - "Translate this" now has an additional language field, so that only a subset
          of the available languages may be chosen [thomasw]
        - Ran the pep8 script and fixed most issues [thomasw]

        1.3.1 (2009-12-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Be more relaxed with version pinning needed for plone.app.z3cform [thomasw]

        ----------------
        
        - Major revamp at Plone Conference 2009 sprint: moved from static BrowserView
          to z3c form; brushed up test coverage; clearer interface; more user-friendly,
          less typing necessary; easier to plug in new functionality [cillian, jcbrand,
          pilz, thomasw, Andreas Schmid]
        
        1.2.5 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        - make sure that lang is ascii when using it to create objectids. Otherwise we get an infinite recursion [pilz]
        - D'oh another bug in "block portlets", this time in the status message [thomasw]
        - better status reporting for translateThis; collection criteria are now also copied when
          "translation exists" is ticked; more graceful handling for unknown fields [thomasw]

        1.2.2 (2009-10-08)
        ------------------
        
        - 2 bugfixes in cutAndPaste (don't despair if object is not available) [thomasw]
        - Added a contenview tab for Lingua Tools on ITranslatable objects [jcbrand]
        - In lingatools.pt moved the legends into the fieldsets, added labels and reorganised a bit [jcbrand]
        - Added new option to remove subtypes [jcbrand]
        - Use the default plone status messages for messaging and added event.log logging [jcbrand]

        TODO
        ****
        
        * Find and use an object-picker widget for "Cut & Paste" - having to type the
          destination path is ugly.
        
        * Distinguish between global functions (e.g. Set title) and those that only
          make sense on a folder (e.g. Delete).
        
        * Add a configuration page in the control panel so that the manager can select
          the available functions (e.g. exclude the Marker Interface function)
