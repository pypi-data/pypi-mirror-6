        =================================================================
        
        Use notes to write meeting minutes, organize ideas, organize personnal todo
        lists, etc. Each user manages his own personnal Notes. Notes are available to
        their authors only, but they can share notes to others users so that several
        people can work on the same note in real time. It's very efficient to share
        meeting minutes.
        
        Notes can be found in the 'Home' menu.
