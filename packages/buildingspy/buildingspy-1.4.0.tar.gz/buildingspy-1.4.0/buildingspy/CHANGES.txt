BuildingsPy Changelog
---------------------

Version 1.4.0, February 28, 2014 -- Release 1.4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- In development.unittest, added test that addresses the situation
  that some results are parameters in the Buildings library, but
  variables in the Annex 60 library.
- In simulate.Simulator, corrected error that prevented output
  files from being copied if the result directory was set to '.'
- Added unit tests and documentation tests.
- Corrected various errors in the documentation.
- Renamed development.unittest to development.regressiontest. This
  was required for the python doctest to work.
- In development.regressiontest, added new method setLibraryRoot(rootDir)
  to allow running the unit tests from a directory other than the library
  root directory.
- In development.regressiontest, added a test that avoids an IndexError
  if a new simulation result contains a different number of support points 
  than the reference result. This is needed if models change variables
  to parameters or vice versa.
- In development.regressiontest, added the method setSinglePackage.
  This allows running the regression tests for a single package only.


Version 1.3.0, October 24, 2013 -- Release 1.3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added class buildingspy.development.validator
  that can be used to validate the html syntax
  of the info section of .mo files.
- Added validation of html syntax to unit test script.
- In io.outputfile, changed name of argument of _init__
  from format to simulator as format is a reserved keyword
  in Python.
- In simulate.Simulator, corrected use of variable that was not defined. 
  Avoided use of variable name exit which is a reserved keyword. 
  Avoided the use of temporary variables that are not needed.
- In development.unittest, 

  - removed non-needed import statement,
  - removed argument dir from method printNumberOfClasses(self)
    as this argument is not used.

- Updated to latest version of DyMat as on https://bitbucket.org/jraedler/dymat/,
  commit 4e819cb
- In development.Tester, method __getSimulationResults(),
  corrected error that caused results only to be stored if there is
  at least one variable requested for comparison that has more than 
  two support points. That is, if a script only requested to store 
  parameters, or variables that solely depend on parameters, 
  then no results from this simulation were not stored.


Version 1.2.0, May 15, 2013 -- Release 1.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Changed buildingspy.development.unittest so that 
  the string 'svn-id' is no longer searched in, 
  or written to, the reference result files.
- Improved error reporting of the package that runs
  the unit tests.
- Updated buildingspy.development.unittest to allow testing
  of other libraries than the Buildings library.
- Updated buildingspy.development.unittest to include
  a model check in the pedantic mode of Dymola.


Version 1.1.2, January 8, 2013 -- Release 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed bug in Simulator.py to allow setting Modelica parameters
  that are of type string.


Version 1.1.1, October 9, 2012 -- Release 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Improved error reporting in unittest.py
- Fixed bug in constructor of simulate.Simulator.py that caused
    TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'directory'


Version 1.1.0, July 26, 2012 -- Release 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added class buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.
  This simplifies the creation of boxplot and the
  plotting of data that repeat every day.
- Moved function buildingspy.development.unittest.Tester.__interpolate
  to buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.interpolate
- Caught exception that is caused when non-ascii characters are
  used in the comments of constants, parameters or variables. Now,
  these files are excluded from the unit tests and a warning is issued.
- Centralized error reporting to using buildings.io.reporter instead
  of writing directly to stderr.
- Fixed error in buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.interpolate().
  The previous version could lead to non-increasing time for
  the last time stamp of the results, and then led to an wrong result
  of the interpolation function.
- Changed file output: The output of Dymola is now in the file dymola.log,
  whereas unitTests.log contains the warning and error messages of the python
  unit test scripts.
- Changed buildingspy.development.unittest.py to achieve better load 
  balancing. This change reduced the computing time for all unit tests on a 
  24 core computer from 38 minutes to 21 minutes.

Version 1.0.0, November 1, 2011
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
