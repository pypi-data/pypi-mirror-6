pytest-twisted is a plugin for pytest, which allows to test code,
which uses the twisted framework. test functions can return Deferred
objects and pytest will wait for their completion with this plugin.

Installation
==================
Install the plugin with::

    pip install pytest-twisted


Using the plugin
==================

The plugin must be enabled. This can be done in the following ways:

1. Run py.test with the --twisted command line option

2. Put the following into conftest.py::

    pytest_plugins = "pytest_twisted"

3. Put the following into pytest.ini::

    [pytest]
    twisted = 1


inlineCallbacks
=================
Using `twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks` as a decorator for test
functions, which take funcargs, does not work. Please use
`pytest.inlineCallbacks` instead::

  @pytest.inlineCallbacks
  def test_some_stuff(tmpdir):
      res = yield threads.deferToThread(os.listdir, tmpdir.strpath)
      assert res == []

Waiting for deferreds in fixtures
=================================
`pytest.blockon` allows fixtures to wait for deferreds::

  @pytest.fixture
  def val():
      d = defer.Deferred()
      reactor.callLater(1.0, d.callback, 10)
      return pytest.blockon(d)


The twisted greenlet
====================
Some libraries (e.g. corotwine) need to know the greenlet, which is
running the twisted reactor. It's available from the
`twisted_greenlet` funcarg. The following code can be used to make
corotwine work with pytest-twisted::

  @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
  def set_MAIN(request, twisted_greenlet):
      from corotwine import protocol
      protocol.MAIN = twisted_greenlet


That's all.
