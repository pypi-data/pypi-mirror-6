Description: ======
        ZigZag
        ======
        
        ZigZag provides functions for identifying the peaks and valleys of a time
        series. Additionally, it provides a function for computing the maximum drawdown.
        
        If numba can be imported, it will be used to greatly accelerate the execution 
        time at the cost of a small initial compile. On my machine, the JIT'd code 
        executed about 38 times faster than the pure Python code. Numba is not an 
        install_requires package because numba can be a pain to install for some people. 
        `Learn more about numba here <http://numba.pydata.org/>`_.
