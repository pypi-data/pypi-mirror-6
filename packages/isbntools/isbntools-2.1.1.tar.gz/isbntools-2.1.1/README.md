Info
----

`isbntools` provides several useful methods and functions
to validate, clean, transform, hyphenate and
get metadata for ISBN strings.

Typical usage (as library):

```python

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import isbntools
    ...
```

Several scripts are provided to use **from the command line**:

```bash

    $ to_isbn10 ISBN13
```
transforms an ISBN10 number to ISBN13.

```bash

    $ to_isbn13 ISBN10
```
transforms an ISBN13 number to ISBN10.

```bash

    $ isbn_info ISBN
```
gives you the *group identifier* of the ISBN.

```bash

    $ isbn_mask ISBN
```
*masks* (hyphenate) an ISBN (split it by identifiers).

```bash

    $ isbn_meta ISBN
```
gives you the main metadata associated with the ISBN, `wcat` uses *worldcat.org*
(**no key is needed**), `goob` uses the *Google Books service* (**no key is needed**),
`isbndb` uses the *isbndb.com* service (**an api key is needed**), `merge` uses
a mergeded record of `wcat` and `goob` records (**no key is needed**) and
**is the default option** (you only have to enter, e.g. `isbn_meta 9780321534965`).
You can get an API key for the *isbndb.com service* [here](http://isbndb.com/api/v2/docs).

```bash

    $ isbn_editions ISBN
```
gives the collection of ISBNs that represent a given book (uses worldcat.org).

```bash

    $ isbn_validate ISBN
```
validates ISBN10 and ISBN13.

```bash

    $ ... | isbn_stdin_validate
```
to use with *posix pipes* (e.g. `cat FILE_WITH_ISBNs | isbn_stdin_validate`).

```bash

    $ isbn_from_words "words from title and author name"
```
a *fuzzy* script that returns the *most probable* ISBN from a set of words.
(You can verify the result with `isbn_meta`)!

```bash

    $ isbntools
```
writes version and copyright notice.

Many more scripts could be written with the `isbntools` library,
using the methods for extraction, cleaning, validation and standardization of ISBNs.

Just for fun, suppose I want the *most spoken about* book with certain words in his title.
For a *quick-and-dirty solution*, enter the following code in a file
and save it as `isbn_tmsa_book.py`.

```python

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import sys
    import urllib2
    from isbntools import *

    query = sys.argv[1].replace(' ', '+')
    SEARCH_URL = "http://www.google.com/search?q=%s+ISBN" % query

    headers = {'User-Agent': 'w3m/0.5.2'}
    request = urllib2.Request(SEARCH_URL, headers=headers)
    response = urllib2.urlopen(request)
    content = response.read()

    isbns = get_isbnlike(content)

    for item in isbns:
        ib = get_canonical_isbn(item, output='isbn13')
        if ib: break

    print("The ISBN of the most `spoken-about` book with this title is %s" % ib)
    print("")
    print("... and the book is:")
    print("")
    print((meta(ib)))
```

Then in a command line (in the same directory):

```bash

    $ python isbn_tmsa_book.py 'noise'
```

In my case I get:

```

    The ISBN of the most `spoken-about` book with this title is 9780143105985

    ... and the book is:

    {'Publisher': u'Penguin Books', 'Language': u'eng', 'Title': u'White noise',
    'Year': u'2009', 'ISBN-13': '9780143105985', 'Authors': u'Don DeLillo ;
    introduction by Richard Powers.'}
```

Have fun!

Install
-------

From the command line enter (in some cases you have to preced the
command by `sudo`):

```bash

    $ pip install isbntools
```
this installs from [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isbntools) or:

```bash

    $ easy_install isbntools
```
this installs from [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isbntools) too, or (to install locally in *Linux* or *Mac OS X*):

```bash

    $ pip install isbntools-2.1.1.tar.gz
```
but first you have to [download](https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/i/isbntools/isbntools-2.1.1.tar.gz) the file!



For Devs
--------

In the namespace `isbntools` you have access to the core methods:
`is_isbn10`, `is_isbn13`, `to_isbn10`, `to_isbn13`, `canonical`,
`clean`, `notisbn`, `get_isbnlike`, `get_canonical_isbn`, `mask`,
`meta`, `info`, `editions`, and `isbn_from_words`.

You can extend the lib by using the classes and functions exposed in
namespace `isbntools.dev`, namely:

* `WEBService` a class that handles the access to web
  services (just by passing an url) and supports `gzip`.
  You can subclass it to extend the functionality... but
  probably you don't need to use it! It is used in the next class.

* `WEBQuery` a class that uses `WEBService` to retrive and parse
  data from a web service. You can build a new provider of metadata
  by subclassing this class. The following classes do that
  (by using the *call pattern*). His main methods allow passing custom
  functions (*handlers*) that specialize them to specific needs (`data_checker` and
  `parser`).

* `GOOBQuery` a class that retrives and parses book metadata,
  using Google Books API (you only have to provide an ISBN).
  The main features can be implemented by a call to `googlebooks.query` function!

* `WCATQuery` a class that retrives and parses book metadata,
  using the `worldcat.org xisbn service` (you only have to provide an ISBN).
  The main features can be implemented by a call to `wcat.query` function!

* `WCATEdQuery` a class that retrives and parses collections of ISBNs related
  with a given book, using the `worldcat.org xisbn service`
  (you only have to provide an ISBN).
  The main features can be implemented by a call to `wcated.query` function!

* `ISBNDBQuery` a class that retrives and parses book metadata,
  using the **isbndb.org service**. However you have to provide an **API key** (in the
  command line you can enter `isbn_meta 9780321534965 isbndb YOURAPIKEY` or,
  programatically, use `isbntools.config.add_apikey` before a call to
  `ISBNDBQuery` or to `isbndb.query`).
  The main features can be implemented by a call to `isbndb.query` function!
  You can get an API key for the *isbndb.com service* [here](http://isbndb.com/api/v2/docs).

* `OPENLQuery` a class that retrives and parses book metadata,
  using `openlibrary.org` (you only have to provide an ISBN).
  The main features can be implemented by a call to `openl.query` function!

* `Metadata` a class that structures, cleans and 'validates' records of
  metadata. His method `merge` allows to implement a simple merging
  procedure for records from different sources. The main features can be
  implemented by a call to `stdmeta` function!

All these classes follow a simple design pattern and, if you follow it, will be
very easy to integrate your classes with the rest of the lib.

If you need high quality metadata in your app, the only solution is to use
*polling & merge* of several providers. A *simple merge* provider is now the default in
`isbn_meta` (and `isbntools.meta`) that gives priority to *wcat* but overwrites
the *Authors* field with the value from *goob*. It uses *threaded* calls to services
and the `merge` method of `Metadata`. You can write your own *merging scheme*
as a new provider (see *dev.merge* for an example).


Known Issues
------------

1. The `meta` method and the `isbn_meta` script sometimes give a wrong result
   (this is due to errors on the worldcat.org service), in alternative you could
   use the Google Books service (e.g. `isbn_meta 9780143105985 goob`).

2. The `isbntools` works internally with unicode, however this doesn't
   solve errors of lost information due to bad encode/decode at the origin!

3. Periodically, agencies, issue new blocks of ISBNs. The
   [*range*](https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation) of
   these blocks is on a database that `mask` uses. So it could happen, if you
   have a version of `isbntools` that is too old, `mask` doesn't work for
   valid (recent) issued ISBNs. The solution? **Update `isbntools` often**!
