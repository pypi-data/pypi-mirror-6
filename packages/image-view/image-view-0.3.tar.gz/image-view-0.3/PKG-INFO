Description: ==========
        image-view
        ==========
        
        ``image-view`` displays images using ``pygame``.
        
        The primary motivation is to support viewing Netpbm images on OS X. For common
        image types, Preview works great. For Netpbm images Xee_ works fine for the
        most part, but it doesn't work properly when displaying a subset of images from
        command line. This is important if there are a series of images captured from
        camera (``captured-00*.pgm``) and you want to display some subset of them.
