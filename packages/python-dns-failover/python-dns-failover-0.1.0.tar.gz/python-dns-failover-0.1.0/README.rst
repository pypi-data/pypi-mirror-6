"Python script to automatically update DNS records for a bunch of servers participating in a Round-Robin DNS setup"

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: http://python-dns-failover.rtfd.org.

This project is mainly based on `@dotcloud`_'s work on his project `autodnsfailover`_.

The main difference is that **python-dns-failover** script is aimed to **run in an external
machine** while `autodnsfailover`_ is to run in the participating servers themselves.
