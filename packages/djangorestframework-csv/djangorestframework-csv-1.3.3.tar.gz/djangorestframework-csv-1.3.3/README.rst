**CSV Tools for Django REST Framework**

**Author:** Mjumbe Wawatu Poe, `Follow me on Twitter <http://www.twitter.com/mjumbewu>`_.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install djangorestframework-csv

Usage
-----

*views.py*

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_framework.views import APIView
    from rest_framework.settings import api_settings
    from rest_framework_csv import renderers as r

    class MyView (APIView):
        renderer_classes = (r.CSVRenderer, ) + api_settings.DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES
        ...

Alternatively, to set CSV as a default rendered format, add the following to the
`settings.py` file:

.. code-block:: python

    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
        # specifying the renderers
        'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': (
            'rest_framework_csv.renderers.CSVRenderer',
        ),
    }

Pagination
----------

Using the renderer with paginated data is also possible, with a little extension.
A paginated CSV renderer is constructed like below, and should be used with views
that paginate data

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_framework_csv.renderers import CSVRenderer

    class PaginatedCSVRenderer (CSVRenderer):
        results_field = 'results'

        def render(self, data, media_type=None, renderer_context=None):
            if not isinstance(data, list):
                data = data.get(self.results_field, [])
            return super(PaginatedCSVRenderer, self).render(data, media_type, renderer_context)

For more information about using renderers with Django REST Framework, see the
`API Guide <http://django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/renderers.html>`_ or the
`Tutorial <http://django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization.html>`_.

Running the tests
-----------------

To run the tests against the current environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./manage.py test
