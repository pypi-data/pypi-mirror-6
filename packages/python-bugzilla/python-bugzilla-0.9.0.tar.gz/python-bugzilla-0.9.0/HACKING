If submitting any patch, please verify that no new pylint or pep8 violations
are introduced:

  python setup.py pylint

And ensure that the basic unit test suite does not regress

  python setup.py test

There are more comprehensive tests that are disabled by default. Readonly
functional tests that run against several public bugzilla instances. No
login account is required:

  python setup.py test --ro-functional

And read/write functional tests. These currently run against the test
bugzilla instance at partner-bugzilla.redhat.com, and requires a valid
login there:

  python setup.py test --rw-functional

Running any of the functional tests is not a requirement for patch submission,
but please give them a go if you are interested.
