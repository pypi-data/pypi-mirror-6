DESCRIPTION
===============================================================================
PyTam is a single module that allows python3 to manipulate databases of
its own. It works for Linux, Mac and Windows.
It can create, delete, update, fetch, match registries and much more. It is not
intended to be a SQL dbm but a python data persistance module that allows managing
data in an efficent way, with more levels of security than other python's
persistance libraries.

Note: It Runs On ANDROID!!!! with QPython 3

If help is needed you can contact me at:

I will not write any code for you, but I can show you what you can do with this
powerful library.

===============================================================================
USAGE EXAMPLE
===============================================================================

from pytam.pytam import *

createTWS("/home/user/","DB", "123") #Create DataBase
tws=useTWS('/home/user/DB', '123', 'UserNameForLogs', 'enable') #Connect to DB

tws.createTable('people',{ # Create Table
                '*id': 'int',
                'name': 'str',
                'lastName': 'str'       
            })

tws.insertInto('people',{    #Add Registry to DB
                'id':0,
                'name':'Joe',
                'lastName':'Doe'
                })

PeopleObtained=tws.fetchAll('people', {'id':0}) # Search by Key Field

PeopleObtained=tws.fetchAll('people', {'name:Joe', 'lastName':'Doe'}) # Search by various fields
