Description: # WifiLEDs Python Library
        
        This package is dedicated to being a cohesive resource point for Wifi LED lighting through Python.
        
        This package currently only contains the API layer for [LimitlessLED bulbs](wifileds/limitlessled) ($16/$19 / bulb), but will soon expand to [LIFX bulbs](http://lifx.co/) ($80 / bulb) which are set to ship in August/September 2013. 
        
        [Philips hue](http://www.meethue.com/) ($60 / bulb) may be looked at into the future, but is currently a bit [expensive](http://www.jon00.me.uk/images/WiFiLEDMatrix.png) for a full house system. Other Python APIs do exist and are linked [here](https://github.com/Q42/hue-libs#python). If any one feels like they want to merge projects, feel free to reach me via GitHub.
        
        Future products that we're looking forward to include:
        
        * From [LimitlessLED](http://whrl.pl/RdBge7):
            * 6W (600 lm) Dual White 2.4Ghz/RF Downlight (June 2013) ~$37 USD
            * 12W (1100 lm) Dual White 2.4Ghz/RF Downlight (June 2013) ~$47 USD
            * 8W Dual White Bulbs (August 2013) ~$17 USD
            * Brighter RGB+White 2.4Ghz/RF Bulbs (October 2013) ~$19 USD
            * New WiFi Bridge (unlimited groups and individual bulb control) (February 2014) ~$17 USD
            * Glass on Black 2.4Ghz/RF In-Wall Switches (October 2014) ~$9 USD
        
        Feel free to add to the list of upcoming products and/or manufactures.
