Description: 
        The gdist module is a Cython interface to a C++ library 
        (http://code.google.com/p/geodesic/) for computing
        geodesic distance which is the length of shortest line between two 
        vertices on a triangulated mesh in three dimensions, such that the line
        lies on the surface. 
        
        The algorithm is due Mitchell, Mount and Papadimitriou, 1987; the implementation
        is due to Danil Kirsanov and the Cython interface to Gaurav Malhotra and 
        Stuart Knock.
