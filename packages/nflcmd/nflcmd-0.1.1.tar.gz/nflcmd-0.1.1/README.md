nflcmd is a set of command line programs for interacting with NFL data using
[nfldb](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb). This includes, but is not limited 
to, viewing game stats, season stats and ranking players by any combination of 
statistical category over any duration.

There are two main goals of this project:

* The commands should be simple with sane defaults.
* Commands should be reasonably fast.


### Documentation and getting help

nflcmd has
[some API documentation](http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/nflcmd), but it's mostly 
only useful to developers seeking to add more commands.

If you need any help or have found a bug, please
[open a new issue on nflcmd's issue 
tracker](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflcmd/issues/new)
or join us at our IRC channel `#nflgame` on FreeNode.


### Installation and dependencies

nflcmd depends only on [nfldb](https://pypi.python.org/nfldb), which includes 
having [a PostgreSQL database accessible to 
you](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Installation).

I've only tested nflcmd with Python 2.7 on a Linux system. In theory, nflcmd 
should be able to work on Windows and Mac systems as long as you can get 
PostgreSQL running. It is **not** Python 3 compatible.


### Examples

Forthcoming.
