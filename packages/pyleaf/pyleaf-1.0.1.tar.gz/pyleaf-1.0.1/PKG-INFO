Description: pyleaf is the Python implementation of the Leaf system. The Leaf
        system is a pipeline (AKA data flow or data analysis protocol)
        management system that allows to design the pipeline as an ASCII-art
        diagram through a language called LGL (Leaf Graph Language, see
        https://github.com/franapoli/lglc).
        
        Main Leaf features include:
        
        - Thin, lightweight, code-independent Abstraction Layer.
        - Data flow graph embedded directly into Python source code.
        - Automatic creation and management of variables associated with node
          outputs.
        - Automatic persistent storage and retrieval of node outputs.
        - Session persistence (i.e. run half project, reboot machine,
          automatically start again from the last processed node).
        - Lazy builds (avoid running nodes that are not necessary for the
          build of a requested resource).
        - Multiprocessing (independent nodes run in parallel).
        - Enforcement of code version consistency between nodes
          (i.e. automatically reprocess all nodes deriving from node A if node
          A is found to be changed).
        - Automatic time and space requirements statistics.
        - Automatic publishing (producing hypertext with visual representation
          of the protocol, processing statistics, link to node outputs, node
          documentation and source code).
