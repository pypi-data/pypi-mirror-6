        FileSystemSite
        ==============
        
        FileSystemSite is a split of CMFCore which contains only components to
        create filesystem based site. You get a Directory View object, which
        let you have Page Template, Python Scripts, Files, which actually
        refer to existing files on the file-system.
        
        For more information, look at the CMFCore documentation.
        
        .. note::
        
           This is a deprecated extension.
