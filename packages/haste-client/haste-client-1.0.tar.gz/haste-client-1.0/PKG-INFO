Description: CLI Haste client ![pypi](http://badge.fury.io/py/haste-client.png)
        ================
        
        A simple client for [Haste server](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server) written in Python.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use pip or easy_install:
        
            pip install haste-client
        
        Haste client needs Python 2.6+ or 3.x (it was tested on 2.7 and 3.3) and following modules:
        
        *  [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)
        *  [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt) >= 0.3.0
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Text can be passed to `haste` via stdin or a file. TTY is also supported.
        
            haste FILE
            cat FILE | haste
        
        URL of the created entry is then printed to STDOUT.
        
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Haste client reads configuration variables from `~/.hastec` and `/etc/hastec.conf` (in this order, first wins). When no such file or the particular variable exists, then default values are used:
        
            server_url = http://hastebin.com
            timeout = 3
