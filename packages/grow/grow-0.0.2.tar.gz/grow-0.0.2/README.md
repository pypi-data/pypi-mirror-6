# Grow SDK [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grow/pygrow.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grow/pygrow)

Welcome to the Grow SDK! Grow is almost certainly the best way for teams to build and launch web sites. It's a file-based static site generator and content management system.

Grow works great for all kinds of content-heavy web sites â€“ fom small personal blogs, to highly-interactive marketing campaigns, to informational web sites for a large organization.

Grow differentiates itself by being:

- entirely file-based and backed by Git (so it works with your favorite tools),
- designed for true structured content management,
- designed with web performance and security in mind,
- designed for developers, designers, content writers, and translators to work together,
- fully international with built-in localization support.

Using Grow, you can:

- develop everywhere (cloud or local, in a browser or on your machine),
- deploy anywhere (Google Cloud Storage, S3, Dropbox, GitHub pages, App Engine, your custom server, etc.),
- launch web sites on demand or at a specific time,
- manage multiple sites (instead of just one),
- collaborate with people, teams, and organizations (via roles, review processes, and project organization).

Visit the Grow SDK's website at http://growsdk.org where you can learn all about using the Grow SDK to build and launch your own web sites.

## In development

The Grow SDK is still under development and is *not quite ready for use*. If you're interested in learning more about the project, please visit the SDK's public website at http://growsdk.org where you can subscribe to our newsletter and be notified when the . You can also watch this repository for updates.

## Quick start usage

Full documentation is available at http://growsdk.org, but this four-step process covers the basic workflow.

(1) Install Grow. (Coming soon: a downloadable Mac application for those without `pip`.)

    # Install Grow system-wide.
    pip install grow
    
    # Install Grow for a single user (recommended).
    pip install --user grow
    
    # Add local pip installations to your PATH. (Put this in ~/.bashrc).
    export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

(2) Initialize a new pod using the "cards" theme.

    grow init cards ~/example.com/

(3) Run a small web server for live editing and previewing.

    grow run ~/example.com/

(4) Deploy your site to the public web.

    grow deploy ~/example.com/

See a full list of commands using: `grow help`.

## Contributing

The Grow SDK is portable by design, and it encapsulates all of its own dependencies so that the SDK can run anywhere (including restricted environments such as Google App Engine).

### Running tests

Here's how you can pull down the Grow SDK and its submodules to contribute:

    # Download Grow and submodules.
    git clone https://github.com/grow/pygrow.git
    cd pygrow && git submodule init && git submodule update && cd ..
    cd pygrow/grow/submodules/babel && python setup.py import_cldr && cd ../../../..
    
To run Grow's unit tests, run from the project's root directory:

    python run_tests.py
    
The Grow SDK also includes service tests, which test the pod server RPC system:

    ./run_service_tests.sh
