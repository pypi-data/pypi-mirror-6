        New extensible file import for OpenERP
        ======================================
        
        Re-implement openerp's file import system:
        
        * Server side, the previous system forces most of the logic into the
          client which duplicates the effort (between clients), makes the
          import system much harder to use without a client (direct RPC or
          other forms of automation) and makes knowledge about the
          import/export system much harder to gather as it is spread over
          3+ different projects.
        
        * In a more extensible manner, so users and partners can build their
          own front-end to import from other file formats (e.g. OpenDocument
          files) which may be simpler to handle in their work flow or from
          their data production sources.
        
        * In a module, so that administrators and users of OpenERP who do not
          need or want an online import can avoid it being available to users.
