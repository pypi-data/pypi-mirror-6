seabird
=======

This is a parser for Sea Bird CTD output files.

The `Sea Bird CTD`_ post processed data usually uses the .cnv extention. The purpose of the PyCNV is to parse this type of files, considering the different versions along the time, as well as different setups.

At this point my goal is to have an object with the attributes parsed from the header, and the data as Masked Arrays, so that the user don't need to loose time evaluating the version and details of that cnv, but have it in a standard pattern, ready to use.

ATENTION, this is not an official package, so if you have trouble with this package, do not complain to Sea-Bird.

Support and Documentation
-------------------------

See the `Seabird Wiki`_ to view documentation, report bugs, and obtain support.

The `Seasoft`_ manual might be the best reference for the format used.

The variables names were based on the `pcmdi standard name table`

If PyCNV don't work with your .cnv files, send me a sample (just one .cnv) and I'll fix to run it. The SeaBird changed the format several times along the time, so I need to see what do you have, to adjust PyCNV to work with it.

Quick howto use
---------------

To install:

    pip install seabird


One way to use is running on the shell the cnvdump. Independent of the historical version of the cnv file, it will return a default structure: 

    cnvdump your_file.cnv


To convert a .cnv to a NetCDF, run:

    cnv2cdf your_file.cnv


In a python script, one can use like this:

    from seabird.cnv import fCNV

    profile = fCNV('your_file.cnv')

    profile.attributes  # It will return the header, as a dictionary.

    profile.keys() # It will list the available variables.

    profile['temperature2'] # If temperature2 was on the .keys(), this is how you get the data. It will be a masked array.
