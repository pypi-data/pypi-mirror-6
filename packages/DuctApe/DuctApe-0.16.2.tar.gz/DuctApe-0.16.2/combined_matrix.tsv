# Combined matrix for the pangenome
# Each cell contains the average difference on the AV  between each organism of the pangenome
#  Compounds are sorted by mean diffAV,  pathways by genomic variability (number of variable reaction IDs / numer of distinct reaction IDs)
#  mean diffAV threshold: 5.000000
#  genomic variability threshold: > 0
