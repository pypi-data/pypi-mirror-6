Description: =========
        SilvaPoll
        =========
        
        
        SilvaPoll is an extension to have traditional polls inside Silva
        sites. A question is asked on which the public can answer, and results
        are displayed to those that do. The poll can be an independent page or
        be embedded in a Silva Document as a Code Source.
        
        Making a Poll
        =============
        
        Creating Silva Poll Questions
        -----------------------------
        
        After following the installation instructions you can add a Silva Poll
        Question in the SMI. Fill in all required fields and save the
        question, repeat this step for all questions. Separate answers by an
        empty line.
        
        Rendering the Silva Poll
        ------------------------
        
        You can use the Poll Questions like documents, and send visitors there
        via a link in content or navigation.
        
        You can also embed Poll Questions in Silva Document. When editing a
        document, click on external sources and add all of your questions
        (don't forget to hit the "add external source" button ;-).
        
        - Rendering the poll immediately:
          Publish your Silva Poll Questions and/or Silva Document and that's it.
        
        - Rendering time based Silva Poll Questions and their result:
          In the SMI go to the publish tab of a Silva Poll Question and fill in dates as
          appropriate.
        
        Fill in the options you would like to set:
        
        - question display start time: time when a Silva Poll Question should
          be displayed for the public.
        
        - question display end time: time when a Silva Poll Question should
          stop being displayed for the public.
        
        - results display start time: time when the result of Silva Poll
          Question should be displayed for the public.
        
        - results display end time: time when the result of Silva Poll
          Question should stop being displayed for the public.
