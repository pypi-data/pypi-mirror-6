        What is it?
        -----------
        
        This plugin adds "Relationships" fields to each ticket, enabling you
        to express cross-reference between tickets.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Provide simple cross-reference as Trac custom field (``ticketref``)
        * Create new ticket with related ticket's field value
        * Picking up the referred ticket in comment
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        To enable the plugin::
        
            [components]
            ticketref.* = enabled
        
            [ticket-custom]
            ticketref = textarea
            ticketref.label = Relationships
            ticketref.cols = 68
            ticketref.rows = 1
        
        If you want to show more small field, change as follows::
        
            [ticket-custom]
            ticketref = text
            ticketref.label = Relationships
        
        i18n/l10n Support
        -----------------
        
        This plugin is able to localize field label or message.
        You can translate into your language using ``ticketref/locale/messages.pot``.
        And then, I'm willing to merge your contribution into the distribution.
        So, let me know if you localized ``ticketref/locale/messages.pot``.
