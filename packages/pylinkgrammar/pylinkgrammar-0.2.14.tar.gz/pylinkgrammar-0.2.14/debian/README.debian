You need CDBS 0.4.90 or higher to build this in debian squeeze,
which currently gets you CDBS v0.4.89. I'm sorry about that, but
I wanted to make the package using the distutils upgrades that happened
in 0.4.90, and not maintain a second package just for squeeze.

Building against a backported cdbs from wheezy makes a perfectly fine squeeze
package, and this should build without any issues on Ubuntu natty and up.
