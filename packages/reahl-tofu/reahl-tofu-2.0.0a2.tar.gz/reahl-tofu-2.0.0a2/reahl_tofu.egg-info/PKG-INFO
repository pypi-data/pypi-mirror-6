Description: Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language. . Tofu is a plugin for nosetests, and part of the Reahl development tools. . Tofu allows you to have a hierarchy of test fixtures that is *completely* decoupled from your hierarchy of tests or test suites. Tofu includes a number of other related test utilities. . Tofu can also be used to run the set_ups of fixtures from the command line.  This is useful for acceptance tests whose fixtures create data in databases that can be used for demonstration and user testing.
