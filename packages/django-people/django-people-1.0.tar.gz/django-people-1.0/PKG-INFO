        =============
        
        A simple app to show person profiles, for example for the "About us" section
        of a website.
        
        Comes with a django-cms plugin and is multilingual.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you want to install the latest stable release from PyPi::
        
            $ pip install django-people
        
        If you feel adventurous and want to install the latest commit from GitHub::
        
            $ pip install -e git://github.com/bitmazk/django-people.git#egg=people
        
        Add ``people`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...,
                'people',
            )
        
        Run the South migrations::
        
            ./manage.py migrate people
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Use the Django admin to create your person objects. If you are using django-cms
        you can use the ``Person Plugin`` to display a person in your placeholders.
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        PERSON_PLUGIN_DISPLAY_TYPE_CHOICES
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        Default::
        
            [
                ('small', _('small')),
                ('big', _('big')),
            ]
        
        When using the ``Person Plugin`` in your django-cms placeholders you will
        notice that you only have two choices for the ``Display type``. This field
        can be helpful when you want to render a person differently in different parts
        of your site. If you need even more display types, just set this setting to
        a different list of tuples.
