C     In order to interpolate a two dimensional grid [0,1] × [0,1], we *
C   sequentially used 1D cubic interpolation formula. First,  we       *
C   interpolated the intensities and normal to boundaries first        *
C   derivatives at two horizontal boundary lines [0,0]-[1,0] and       *
C   [0,1]-[1,1].                                                       *
C     For intensities' interpolation the intensities and tangential    *
C   first derivatives in grid nodes were used.                         *
C     For normal derivatives' interpolation the normal derivatives and *
C   cross-derivatives in grid nodes were used.                         *
C     Thereafter we carried out the vertical cubic interpolation on    *
C   line between 2 horizontal line with a given value of X to obtain   *
C   the intensity on vertical coordinate Y inside the square cell.     *
C   This last procedure was done using previously interpolated values  *
C   of intensities and their first normal derivatives across cell      *
C   boundaries.                                                        *
C       The first derivatives dF/dX, dF/dY and a cross-derivative      *
C   d2F/dXdY  in grid nodes were obtained by calculating 2D            *
C   Fourier transform of image, and then calculating the inverse       *
C   Fourier transform of {ik*F(k,l)}, il*F(k,l)}, and {ikl*F(k,l)}.    *
C      This well-known formula is computationally efficient and very   *
C   convenient for calculating the derivatives of a  function defined  *
C   as a discrete data set, and allows to calculate the derivative in  *
C   any local point without the finite difference approximation        *
C   involving the data from neighboring points.                        *
C                                                                      *
C      The result of this interpolation is similar to those of         *
C   standard bicubic spline interpolation (the densities and their     *
C   both derivatives are continuous at boundaries), but has fewer      *
C   interpolation artifacts, preserving the fine details and sharp     *
C   boundaries from blurring, because our algorithm involves the       *
C   densities and three partial derivatives just from 4 pixels         *
C   surrounding the area for interpolation instead 16 pixels as in     *
C   standard algorithm with the finite difference approximation.       *
C                                                                      *
