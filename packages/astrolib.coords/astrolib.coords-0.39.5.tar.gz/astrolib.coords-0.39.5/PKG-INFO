Description: This package aims to provide much of the IDL "astron" functionality that
        pertains to coordinate manipulations in an OO framework. Our target user is
        a typical astronomer who needs to analyze data, work with catalogs, prepare
        observing proposals, and prepare for observing runs.
        
        It depends on numpy, which must already be installed on your
        system.
        
        It incorporates the TPM library, graciously contributed by Jeff
        Percival, to perform coordinate system transformations. This will be
        installed as part of the package installation.
        
        Install this package in the usual way:
        
        python setup.py install
        
        After installation, you can test the package as follows:
        
        >>> import coords as C
        >>> C._test()
        
        A successful test run will produce no output from this command.
        
        If you have questions about this module, send mail to
        help@stsci.edu and it will get to the appropriate
        person.
