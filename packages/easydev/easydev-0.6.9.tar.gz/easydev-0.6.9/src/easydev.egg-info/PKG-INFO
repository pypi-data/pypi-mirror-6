Description: The package **easydev** provides utilities that are of general usage
        for the development of Python packages. For instance, it provides the
        sphinx templates being used for this documentation. It is also used by
        other packages where documentation using Sphinx is being used (e.g., rtools, 
        spectrum). It provides tools such as multisetup (to ease the development of
        several packages within a single namespace), get_share_directory of any package,
        functions that are used often such as type checking...
