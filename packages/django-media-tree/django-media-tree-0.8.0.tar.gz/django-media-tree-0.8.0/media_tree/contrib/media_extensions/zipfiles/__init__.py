The *zipfiles* extension adds support for ZIP archives to the ``FileNodeAdmin``.
If it is installed, you can select files and folders in the admin and
download them as a ZIP archive. 

To install it, add the extension module to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::   

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ... your apps here ...
        'media_tree.contrib.media_extensions.zipfiles'
    )
