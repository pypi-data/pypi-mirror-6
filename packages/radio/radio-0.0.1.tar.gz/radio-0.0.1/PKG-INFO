Description: =====
        radio
        =====
        
        **radio** is a python script to just listen to the radio using mplayer.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Use::
        
            $ sudo pip install radio
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Listen to the radio::
        
            $ radio <radio_id>
        
        where <radio_id> must be in radio.lists.urls.
        
        List available radios::
        
            $ radio -l
            
        Turn off the radio by pressing "q" (as it uses mplayer).
        
        Add more radios just editing lists/radios.py
        
        To do
        =====
        
        - make command for adding radios more easily, perhaps using doit
        - support multiples lists
        - use curl instead mplayer if available
        - use cvlc instead mplayer if available
