Description: 
        libtfr provides high-performance C and Python libraries for
        calculating multitaper time-frequency reassignment (TFR) spectrograms
        as well as conventional STFTs.  TFR spectrograms have enhanced
        signal-to-noise characteristics and can provide very precise spectral
        estimates under many conditions. The library requires FFTW for the underlying
        FFT transformations.
