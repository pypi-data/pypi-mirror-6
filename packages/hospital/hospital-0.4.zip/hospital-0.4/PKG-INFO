        hospital: healthchecks for Python
        #################################
        
        `hospital` is a Python framework to write health checks, smoke tests or
        diagnoses around applications or services.
        
        
        ********
        Abstract
        ********
        
        Health checks are kind of tests, applied to running applications and services:
        
        * write healtchecks just as you would write tests, using assertions;
        * collect and run healthchecks with test runners;
        * use healthchecks to validate deployments;
        * plug healthchecks in supervision and monitoring tools;
        * in case of incidents, use healthchecks to diagnose problems.
