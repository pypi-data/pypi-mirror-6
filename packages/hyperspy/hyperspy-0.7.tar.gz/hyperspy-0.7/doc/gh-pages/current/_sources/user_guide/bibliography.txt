.. _articles-about-hyperspy:

Peer-review articles about Hyperspy
-----------------------------------

At the moment we are working in the first article about Hyperspy. However, a 
number of papers have already been published by the Hyperspy authors 
(see :ref:`articles-about-hyperspy:`).

.. _articles-using-hyperspy:

Peer-review articles with results obtained using Hyperspy
---------------------------------------------------------

Although we did not make any stable release of Hyperspy yet, it has already been 
used by the authors or collaborators to obtain results that have lead to 
peer-review publications.

If you have made any publication using Hyperspy (or its ancestor, EELSLab) and 
you would like to include it in the following list send us a mail to the 
`developers mailing list <hyperspy-devel@googlegroups.com>` and we will happily 
include it here.


.. Warning::
    The articles published before 2012 may mention the Hyperspy project under 
    its old name, EELSLab
