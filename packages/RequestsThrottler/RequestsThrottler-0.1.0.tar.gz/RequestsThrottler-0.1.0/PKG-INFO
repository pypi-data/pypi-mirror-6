Description: RequestsThrottler: HTTP requests throttler
        ==========================================
        
        RequestsThrottler is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, and powered by futures and `Requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_.
        
        With RequestsThrottler you can easily throttle HTTP requests! After having created your throttler with a delay of your choice, you just have to:
        
        1. Start the throttler 
        2. Submit your requests
        3. Shutdown the throttler
        
        Here's an example:
        ::
        
            bt = BaseThrottler(name='base-throttler', delay=1.5)
            request = requests.Request(method='GET', url='http://www.google.com')
        
            bt.start()
            throttled_request = bt.submit(request)
            bt.shutdown()
        
            response = throttled_request.response
        
        
        Too hard? Then just submit your requests inside a with statement! Here's an example:
        ::
        
            with BaseThrottler(name='base-throttler', delay=1.5):
                request = requests.Request(method='GET', url='http://www.google.com')
                throttled_request = bt.submit(request)
        
            response = throttled_request.response
        
        
        Try also the ``example.py`` by running:
        ::
        
            >>> python -m requests_throttler.example
