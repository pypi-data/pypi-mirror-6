Description: ===========================
        PyBan - Kanban with Python!
        ===========================
        
        Pyban is a Kanban board management tool for the command line.
        Its interface is implemented in curses.
        
        Pyban saves its kanban boards in the .pyban folder located in the
        folder where pyban was run. Recommended usage is running pyban
        either from your project folder, or from your home folder.
        
        If you haven't heard about Kanban, I suggest you look it up on
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban.
