Description: nose-parallel
        =============
        
        A plugin to help split up your tests runs across multiple machines.
        
        In an ideal world, test suites should be fast enough that they can 
        be run locally on a single machine without extra engineering. This 
        plugin is there to help when you can't make that to happen.
        
        This **won't** help you run tests in parallel on one machine in different 
        threads; that's what the built-in `multiprocess 
        <http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins/multiprocess.html>`_ plugin 
        is for.
        
        This **will** help you split up your test suites so that you can run the 
        suites on multiple machines and not have the same test run twice - think 
        Jenkins with the 
        `multijob <https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Multijob+Plugin>`_ 
        plugin, or CI services like `CircleCI <https://circleci.com/docs/parallel-manual-setup>`_.
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        .. code::
        
           pip install nose-parallel
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        On each machine:
        
        #. Export environment variables ``NODE_TOTAL`` (the number of machines on which the suite will be run) and and ``NODE_INDEX`` (the 0-based index of the current machine)
        #. Run nosetests with the ``--with-parallel`` flag
        #. Do something to join the results from all the machines back together
        
        For example, this is how we'd run nosetests on the second machine in a 
        four-machine testing cluster:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           NODE_TOTAL=4 NODE_INDEX=1 nosetests --with-parallel
           
           
        If you don't set those variables, ``nose-parallel`` will do the right thing and run all your tests. 
        The CircleCI versions of the environment variables (``CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL`` and ``CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX``, 
        respectively) are also natively supported.
