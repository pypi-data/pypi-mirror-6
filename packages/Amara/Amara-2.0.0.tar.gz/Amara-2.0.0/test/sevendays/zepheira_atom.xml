    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The
<a href="http://www.w3.org/">
 W3C
</a>
and its members have long sought the ability to mix extractable structured content with existing publishing processes to improve the machine-processability of the Web.
<a href="http://microformats.org/">
 Microformats
</a>
have been a successful step in this direction, but the models embraced by the domain-specific formats are not global or interoperable. The rich layers of the Semantic Web initiative have not easily been integrated until now allowing documents to indicate metadata that can be expressed in the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">
 Resource Description Framework (RDF)
</a>
model. Publishers now have a low-effort semantic markup capability that client tools will begin to harvest as a natural part of the browsing process. No longer will "where on the Web" and "when" be the only extracted information from browsing sessions, but also "who authored the pages" and "where are they about" and "what content can be reused based on the license". The RDFa initiative grew out of the
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">
 Creative Commons
</a>
efforts to express license metadata about published content but grew to support a wider set of use cases.

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">

  free teleconference seminar series led by Earley and

</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Industry experts have been awakening recently to the exceptional power of the Web to integrate information systems, and how it should be applied within the enterprise. You've heard of Enterprise 2.0, Enterprise Mashups and the like. These are generally shallow attempts to translate Web concepts to traditional IT. It is important not to miss the key ingredient for successfully harnessing the power of Web architecture--semantic technology. We all know the power of the Web comes with chaos--wide-ranging workflow conventions, malware and more. Semantic technology adapts traditional business analysis and enterprise architecture to temper the chaos without losing the power.
 </p>
 <p>
  This session connects the prevailing industry trend towards Semantic technology to the characteristics of enterprises, giving you tools for assessing your organization's readiness, and determining the best launch points. It's a practical guide using specific case studies to help you get started using semantic technology to finally reconcile information technology with business imperatives, and to save costs and avoid failures in architecture and integration projects.

<blockquote>
 <p>
  Many organizations needing to exchange information and knowledge with each other question how they can support such connectivity from the front end (between users) to the back end (between systems). The terminology of employees concerned with policy is not the language of the typical visitor or partner on the Web.... How can semantic modeling provide solutions to such problems?

</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  "Think of how we traditionally deal with data in informatics. We look to fit data into neat partitions, shepherd it along neat lines and fit it into grand unified theory. All good, hard science. The problem is that data isn't so easily quantized. It's a living , temperamental entity that absorbs bits of personality from everyone who touches it. Dealing effectively with data requires art, and at Zepheira we really look to the art of data rather than to the science of code. We think adopting the right conventions for data that accommodate its unpredictable qualities is the key to so many of the problems that have dogged IT, and we believe that the web is the most successful set of conventions in this regard. In general we look to apply web architecture to enterprise problems. This brings us right in line with the Linked Data concept, which is really just a way to distill the essential keys to web architecture in a way any developer could tick off his fingers. At Zepheira we start with such principles as the body of art, and we bring together folks who've have proven themselves as journeymen and masters in this art, and we think this positions us to offer particularly effective solutions to our customers."
 </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  "At Zepheira we tend towards techniques popularized in (Linked Open Data), but clearly for most of our clients the data can't be thrown into a cloud of public data, so we've added our own refinements leading to what we've started to call Linking Enterprise Data (LED) to increase the definition of the Linked Data principles as applied to organizational data integration and decision support needs."

  video interview

 with Zepheira partner

  Brian Sletten

 .  Brian discussed the most important topics for developers looking to boost their careers, and emphasized one area where they can make a real difference for their employers.
</p>
<p>
 <blockquote>
  "We spend too much time struggling to get access to our own data.  There are schisms between business and the the rules they want to enforce (such as access control) and the information technologies in place to make this available to them.  We've thrown a lot of money down the drain trying to do integration at the relational DB level, the Enterprise Application Integration level, even at the Services Oriented Architecture level.  While there's a lot of great ideas in that space, it's really the wrong level for integration.
 </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
 <blockquote>
  "Our position is that the Web is the biggest, most successful, scalable example of software architecture that gives you access to data in terms of issuing requests for logical names and getting back physical representations.  It also gives you the flexibility to change the back ends, to change the intermediaries, and allow people to add value on the edge.  They can consume information over here, do some processing on it and republish it....
 </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
 <blockquote>
  "When we look at trying to expose information in the enterprise—I don't care what company you work for, your data integration needs are not bigger and more diverse, and needing to be more scalable than the entire world's, so these technologies have been tremendously successful and you should look for ways to adopt them in your organization."

 Following on the success of their Jolt-Award winning "Beautiful Code" book, O'Reilly Media is publishing a new book of personal essays by notable architects talking about decisions they have made, architectures they have seen, etc. that resulted in "beautiful" systems.
</p>
<p>
 Brian Sletten will be contributing a chapter on the beauty of Resource-Oriented Architectures as a means of enabling information-driven, business-focused systems that scale. The power of the Web applied to the Enterprise not only solves many of the problems not yet solved by a sad string of failed Silver Bullets, but does so with a business-friendly attention to value-driven migration, efficient use of hardware investments, access control, regulatory compliance, etc.

The theme of the conference is "The Wealth of Networks", and sessions will look beyond "Web 2.0" technologies to a new generation of pervasive networks anticipated to cause further disruption and opportunities.  "A wealth of networks allows for smoother collaboration as data and applications quickly make their way to the Web. With networks everywhere, where data resides no longer matters, as long as it’s easily accessible.

<p>
Zepheira and OCLC Online Computer Library Center <a href="http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/200669.htm">announced</a> today that
they will work together to rearchitect OCLC's Persistent URL (PURL)
service to more effectively support the management of a "Web of data."
The software developed will be released under an Apache 2 Open Source
Software license allowing PURLs and the PURL infrastructure to be used
in various applications for public or proprietary use. PURLs provide a
level of indirection that allows the underlying Web addresses of
resources to change over time without negatively affecting systems
that depend on them.  This capability provides continuity of
references to network resources that may migrate from machine to
machine for business, social or technical reasons. The new PURL
software will also be updated to reflect the current understanding of
Web architecture as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
This new software will provide the ability to permanently identify
networked information resources, such as Web documents, as well as
non-networked resources such as people, organizations, concepts and
scientific data.  This capability will represent an important step
forward in the adoption of a machine-processable "Web of data"
enabled by the Semantic Web.</p>

<p>OCLC identified Zepheira for their expertise with Semantic technology
and retained their services for the design and implementation effort
required to bring the PURL service to its full potential. Zepheira's
work on identification technology on the scale of the Web dovetails
with their solutions to help organizations manage and integrate data
scattered within their walls.  PURL software is also an important
component in many of Zepheira's enterprise solutions.</p>

<p>"We are very excited to be taking on this work because one of the most
important principles for Zepheira is that developments towards a
Semantic Web can be carefully tuned and scaled to meet the immediate
needs of businesses, while valuable experience from solving enterprise
needs can bring focus to Semantic Web efforts.  This project for OCLC
is a clear embodiment of this interchange, and helps establish Zepheira's
place at the vanguard of data integration as well as enabling the Semantic Web." --
Eric Miller, President, Zepheira</p>

            Kathy MacDougall, Zepheira Principal and founding Product Manager for
            the swoRDFish Metadata Initiative, has co-authored <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/Sun/">The swoRDFish Metadata Initiative: Better,
            Faster, Smarter Web Content</a> with current swoRDFish
            Product Manager, Susie Cone of <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems, Inc.</a>. This case study outlines the way in which Sun
            Microsystems uses Semantic Web technologies to integrate various types
            of product-related information held in many systems across the company
            and drive dynamic delivery of this content to its external web
            properties. The paper was prepared for <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/">W3C's Semantic Web Education
            and Outreach Interest Group</a>, which
            recently launched a site—<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/">Semantic Web Education and Outreach Interest Group:
            Case Studies and Use Cases</a>—to showcase

		    <a href="http://etech.eweek.com">EWeek</a> has published an story by Jim Rapoza discussing the Semantic Web. In 
		    <a href="http://etech.eweek.com/content/web_technology/spinning_the_semantic_web.html">"Spinning the Semantic Web"</a>, Jim interviews Eric Miller of Zepheira and Tim Berners-Lee of the W3C on the increased recognition of need for technologies to assist in semantic integration of data in the Enterprise and on the Web. Even when high profile companies choose not to use specific Semantic Web technologies, it is possible to convert their proprietary data into standard and reusable forms for additional linkage in a web of data. EWeek concludes:</p>

        <p>"Our take is that the Semantic Web will eventually succeed, as it holds too many benefits for too many people to fall by the wayside. But it's also likely that the Semantic Web won't come about in the exact same way that many people envision. The lesson of the Web 2.0 technologies is that users are often surprising in the way they utilize new technologies. Miller told us that he had already seen businesses using Semantic Web technologies in interesting and unexpected ways." <a href="http://etech.eweek.com/content/web_technology/spinning_the_semantic_web.html&amp;ContextSubtypeID=107">"Spinning the Semantic Web"</a>, 29 May 2007.</p>
