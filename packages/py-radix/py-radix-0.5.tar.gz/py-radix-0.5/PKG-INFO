Description: py-radix is an implementation of a radix tree data structure for the storage 
        and retrieval of IPv4 and IPv6 network prefixes.
        
        The radix tree is the data structure most commonly used for routing table 
        lookups. It efficiently stores network prefixes of varying lengths and 
        allows fast lookups of containing networks.
