Description: TaskPlot - Plot your tasks
        ==========================
        
        TaskPlot is a command line tool as well as a Python library module that
        may be used from the command line or from another program to plot
        progress in multiple tasks in a single graph.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        This package should be used with Python 3.4 or any later version of
        Python interpreter.
        
        On a Windows system, the following packages must be installed for
        Python 3.4 from <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>:
        numpy, dateutil, pyparsing, six and matplotlib.
        
        On a Linux system, the python3-matplotlib package and the packages it
        depends on must be installed. On a Debian system, the following command
        may be used to install the required packages and execute the script::
        
            aptitude install python3-matplotlib
        
        This package uses the Matplotlib library to plot graphs. 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        You can install this package using pip3 using the following command::
        
            pip3 install taskplot
        
        You can install this package from source distribution. To do so,
        download the latest .tar.gz file from
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/taskplot>, extract it, then open command
        prompt or shell, and change your current directory to the directory
        where you extracted the source distribution, and then execute the
        following command::
        
            python3 setup.py install
        
        Note that on a Windows system, you may have to replace ``python3`` with
        the path to your Python 3 interpreter.
