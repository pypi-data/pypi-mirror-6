Description: ==============================================
        A bunch of Fabric commands we use all the time
        ==============================================
        
        This package contains a selection of Fabric command we at NiteoWeb use all the
        time. By sharing them online we hope to save someone some time researching how
        certain Plone-oriented tasks are performed with Fabric. Commands contain some
        hardcoded internal stuff, so they are not really usable out-of-the-box, more so
        as a point of reference. If there is interest, we'll rewrite them to be more
        reusable.
