collective.teamwork pre-release To-Do list:
--

* Test for: SiteMembers.login_name()

* Test for: SiteMembers search

* Test for: password reset in SiteMembers.

* Integration test for getting portrait in SiteMembers.

* Evaluate if we want some sort of set/get interface for
  user portrait, or if we want to continue having it be
  read-only (may be best delayed until Plone has PAS
  plugin for portraits?).

* Make README.txt -> README.rst

* Narrative explanation of what/how in README, including
  screenshots of core elements.

* Check on action icon for membership tab; verify correct.

* Move repository to github.com/collective
