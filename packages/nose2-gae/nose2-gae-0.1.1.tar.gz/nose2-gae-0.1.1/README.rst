Plugin for the `nose2 testrunner <https://nose2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ to run the tests in the Google App Engine environment, similar to `NoseGAE <https://github.com/Trii/NoseGAE>`_.

Currently in alpha version. The most notable missing features are the import/file sandbox and documentation :-).
