        Introduction
        ============
        
        This extensions log in details user actions in `Silva`_. To do so, you
        need to add a *Silva Security Logging Service* in ZMI, in a site
        (either your Silva Root or a local site).
        
        You can configure the logging output. By default it will be logged in
        the Zope logs, but you can log to an SQL database as well.
        
        In order to do this, you need to configure a SQL connection in Zope to
        your database, and in *Silva Security Logging Service* to select SQL
        logging, and your database identifier. The connected database should
        have a table called ``log`` created like this::
        
          create table log (
              username varchar(255),
              action varchar(255),
              time datetime,
              content varchar(512),
              content_intid bigint,
              info varchar(255))
        
        
        .. note::
        
           This table is not automatically created for you.
        
        .. note::
        
           You can name your table differently, and configure the name on the
           service.
        
        The log storage is extensible, you can provide your own storage.
