Structs declared with '<span style="font-family: monospace;">cdef+ struct</span>' may have constructors and member functions, there is a '<span style="font-family: monospace;">new</span>' operator for instantiating them, and they may be deallocated using the '<span style="font-family: monospace;">del</span>' operator. Details may be found in the <a href="LanguageOverview.html">Language Overview</a> under <a href="Manual/using_with_c++.html">Using Pyrex with C++</a>.<br><h2>Changes to Exception Semantics</h2>The
behaviour surrounding exceptions caught using a try-except statement
were previously an inconsistent mixture of Pyrex and Python semantics.
Attempts to make the behaviour match Python more closely were requiring
the generation of increasingly convoluted and inefficient code, so I
decided to backtrack and return to something simpler.<br><br>Pyrex no
longer places caught exceptions into the thread state. This ensures
that exceptions and tracebacks do not leak out of the except clause
that caught them, unless you do something to explicitly preserve them.<br><br>It also means that you <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot</span> retrieve an caught exception in Pyrex using <span style="font-family: monospace;">sys.exc_info()</span>. If you want to capture the exception, you need to bind it to a name in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">except</span> clause.<br><br>To capture the traceback, the syntax of the <span style="font-family: monospace;">except</span> clause has been extended to allow a third argument. For example,<br><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">try:<br>  start_vehicle()<br>except HovercraftError, err, tb:<br>  print "Can't start:", err<br>  traceback.print_tb(tb)<br></pre>As previously, a <span style="font-family: monospace;">raise</span> statement with no arguments must be lexically enclosed in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">except</span>
clause which caught the exception that you are trying to re-raise. In
order to re-raise it from somewhere else, you will need to explicity
communicate the exception and traceback to that place and use an
ordinary <span style="font-family: monospace;">raise</span> statement.<br><h2>Planned Change to None-checking</h2>Currently,
an argument to a Python function that is declared as an extension type
will, by default, be allowed to receive the value None; to prevent
this, you must qualify the argument declaration with '<span style="font-family: monospace;">not None</span>'.<br><br>This
arrangement has proved to be error-prone, because it requires the
programmer to be aware of the 'not None' feature and to remember to use
it everywhere necessary. Failure to do so results in a Pyrex module
that is prone to being crashed hard if it is passed a None value that
it is not expecting.<br><br>To improve this situation, I am planning to make '<span style="font-family: monospace;">not None</span>' the default in a future release of Pyrex. In order to allow None as a legal argument value, it will be necessary to use an '<span style="font-family: monospace;">or None</span>' qualifier.<br><br>In release 0.9.9, the '<span style="font-family: monospace;">or None</span>'
qualifier may be used, but it is optional. In preparation for the
change of default, the Pyrex compiler will issue a warning (once per
run) if it encounters an extension type argument that is not qualified
with either 'or None' or 'not None'. For example, if <span style="font-family: monospace;">Spam</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">Eggs</span> are extension types and you have a function declared as<br><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">def frobulate(Spam s, Eggs e not None):<br>  ...<br></pre>then in order to eliminate the warning, you will need to change it to<br><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">def frobulate(Spam s or None, Eggs e not None):<br>  ...</pre>In a later release, when 'not None' has become the default, it will be possible to drop the 'not None' qualifiers.<br><h2>Non-GC Extension Types</h2>It
is now possible to define and extension type with Python attributes
that does not participate in cyclic garbage collection, using a new <span style="font-family: monospace;">nogc</span> option, for example:<br><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">cdef class Spam [nogc]:<br>  """This class doesn't participate in GC even though<br>     it has a Python attribute."""<br>  object sausages</pre><h2>Other New Features</h2>Some other minor feature additions and modifications have been made.<br><ul><li><span style="font-family: monospace;">size_t </span>is now a built-in type and is the type returned by the <span style="font-family: monospace;">sizeof</span> operator. Also, the sizes of <span style="font-family: monospace;">size_t</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">Py_ssize_t</span> are now assumed to be somewhere between <span style="font-family: monospace;">long</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">long long</span>.<br><br></li><li>Operations
between two int types of the same rank now return an
unsigned result if either of the operands is unsigned; if the ranks
differ, the result has the same type as the wider-ranked operand. I
think this is the best
approximation of the ANSI C rules that is possible without knowing the
exact sizes of the types.<br><br><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></li><li><span style="font-family: monospace;">PyString_InternFromString</span> is now exposed under the name <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">cintern</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>rather than <span style="font-family: monospace;">intern</span>, because it is not a complete replacement for the Python <span style="font-family: monospace;">intern</span> function (it can't handle strings containing null bytes).<br></li><li>The
size check that was previously generated when importing an extension
type has been disabled for the time being until I can think of
something better. It was generating too many false positives, for
example from different versions of numpy.<br><br></li><li>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">__fastcall</span> calling convention option is now supported. Also, Pyrex no longer assumes that <span style="font-family: monospace;">__cdecl</span>
is the default calling convention. To be considered compatible, two
function types must either be declared with the same calling
convention, or both must leave it unspecified.<br><br></li><li>As I have been threatening for some time, using <span style="font-family: monospace;">__new__</span>
as the name of the initialisation method of an extension type has
become an error rather than just a warning. In some future release, <span style="font-family: monospace;">__new__</span> will re-emerge with more Python-like semantics.</li></ul><br></body></html>
