===============================
  Installing gridDataFormats
===============================

Follow the standard python instructions (using "setuptools", also
known as "easy_install").

In order to install into the default system directories::

  python setup.py install

If you don't have NumPy_ installed it will download and install it
automatically.

For some functionality you will also need to install scipy_.


For other ways of installing have a look at the documentation for
`easy_install`_, in particular notes on "Custom Install Locations".
