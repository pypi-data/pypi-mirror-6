Description: 
        
        Email Templating (simplified version of the original Power Email by Openlabs).
        ==============================================================================
        
        Lets you design complete email templates related to any OpenERP document (Sale
        Orders, Invoices and so on), including sender, recipient, subject, body (HTML and
        Text). You may also automatically attach files to your templates, or print and
        attach a report.
        
        For advanced use, the templates may include dynamic attributes of the document
        they are related to. For example, you may use the name of a Partner's country
        when writing to them, also providing a safe default in case the attribute is
        not defined. Each template contains a built-in assistant to help with the
        inclusion of these dynamic values.
        
        If you enable the option, a composition assistant will also appear in the sidebar
        of the OpenERP documents to which the template applies (e.g. Invoices).
        This serves as a quick way to send a new email based on the template, after
        reviewing and adapting the contents, if needed.
        This composition assistant will also turn into a mass mailing system when called
        for multiple documents at once.
        
        These email templates are also at the heart of the marketing campaign system
        (see the ``marketing_campaign`` application), if you need to automate larger
        campaigns on any OpenERP document.
        
            **Technical note:** only the templating system of the original Power Email by Openlabs was kept.
