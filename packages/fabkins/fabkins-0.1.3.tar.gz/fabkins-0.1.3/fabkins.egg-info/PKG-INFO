Description: Fabkins
        =======
        
        Femto-jenkins based on fabfiles.
        
        Features
        --------
        
          - **simple, tiny and fast.**
          - no database :
            - old build logs are in plain text.
            - job configurations are short json files.
            - fabfiles are actually just fabfiles. You could use them without fabkins.
          - builds can be triggered by hand or by web-hooks.
          - output of current builds can be visualized in "realtime" with websockets.
