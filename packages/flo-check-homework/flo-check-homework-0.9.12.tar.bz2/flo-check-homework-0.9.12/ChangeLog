	Improve game "decoration"

	* flo-check-homework-decorate-games: read the input in a new XML-based
	format instead of the old format with TAB separators.

	* flo-check-homework-decorate-games: use argparse for options
	processing.

	* flo-check-homework-decorate-games: make the locales used in launcher
	scripts for running flo-check-homework and for starting the games
	configurable through options --fch-locale and --prog-locale, which
	respectively default to fr_FR.UTF-8 and en_US.UTF-8.

	* flo-check-homework-decorate-games: new options --real-dir and
	--wrapper-dir, which respectively default to /usr/games and
	/usr/local/games.

	* fch-convert-old-data-file-to-xml: new script to ease transition from
	the old "datafile" format with TAB separators to the new XML-based

	Formatting fixes

	Fortify the magic word

	* flo_check_homework/main.py (MainWindow.magicFormula): in order to make
	"replay attacks" against the magic formula harder, implement the
	following measures:
	  - the magic word is now a function of 3 variables instead of 2 (use
	    the source, Luke!);
	  - after 3 failed attempts, the magic wand stops working;
	  - ditto after the first successful attempt, since it is not needed
	    anymore.

	Improve version metadata

	* flo_check_homework/__init__.py: new VersionInfo class providing
	something similar to what is returned by sys.version_info.

	* flo_check_homework/__init__.py: new module-level variables
	'version_info' and '__version__'. flo_check_homework.version_info is a
	VersionInfo instance and flo_check_homework.__version__ a string
	representation of this object, giving the expected version "number" (a
	string such as "0.9.11b1").

	* flo_check_homework/main.py: use the new __version__ attribute.

	* setup.py: use the new __version__ attribute and change the download
	url to reflect the new directory layout for release tarballs (one
	directory per version, with eventual sub-releases such as 0.9.11b1 being
	grouped with the corresponding release [0.9.11]).

2013-08-30  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Minor changes to Makefile and README.rst

	* Makefile: use variables for lrelease-qt4 and pylupdate4 to allow easy
	overriding of the program names.

	* README.rst: new section about the Git repository.

2013-08-29  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Reference the .bz2 instead of .gz file for "download_url" in setup.py

	Release 0.9.11

2013-08-29  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Working i18n with French translation

	* The default language (under the "C" locale) is English. If the locale
	is properly set up, it is used to determine the interface language.

	* Currently, the only available translation is in French. There is also
	French-specific code (that depends on French grammar) in
	exercise_generator.py that is only available when running
	flo-check-homework under a French locale.

2013-08-25  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	Rewrite all translatable strings in English

	* This is the first part of proper i18n.

2013-08-22  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Release 0.9.10.

	* setup.cfg: remove the "prefix=/usr/local" setting that breaks
	installations with pip in a virtualenv (at least).

	* setup.cfg: don't build zip source distributions anymore (to save
	space...).

	* setup.py: simplify as much as possible, which implies that the
	source distribution now ships README.rst instead of README.xhtml.

2013-06-23  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Release 0.9.9.

	* flo_check_homework/conjugations/fr_FR.py: fix a spelling error
	in a conjugation of "venir".

2013-04-01  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Release 0.9.8.

	* flo_check_homework/main.py: fix wrong value of score_threshold
	due to a mistake in the previous change.

2013-03-25  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Release 0.9.7.

	* flo_check_homework/main.py: adjust score_threshold to use the
	same value that triggers the transition between images from
	20-not_good_enough to 30-happy in order to avoid confusion
	(getting an image from 20-not_good_enough while still being able
	to run the desired program is certainly confusing).
	* flo_check_homework/main.py: use float("-inf") as the lowest
	threshold in reward_images, although it should not change anything
	for now, as the score cannot be negative with the current defaults
	set in the various question generators.

2013-03-14  Florent Rougon  <f.rougon@free.fr>

	* Initial release (0.9.6).
