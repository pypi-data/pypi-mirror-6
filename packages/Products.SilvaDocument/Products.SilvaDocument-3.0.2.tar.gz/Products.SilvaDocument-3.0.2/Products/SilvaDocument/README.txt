Silva Document
==============

Silva Document allow you to create structured documents, using the
WYSIWYG `Kupu`_ editor.

In `Silva`_ 3.0, the Kupu editor is no longer supported. This
extension does no longer let edit documents with `Kupu`_. But you can
use to render documents, and convert them to the new document type of
`Silva`_ 3.0, ``silva.app.document``.

In previous versions of Silva, you can use this extension to edit
documents with `Kupu`_. Please look at older versions for this.
