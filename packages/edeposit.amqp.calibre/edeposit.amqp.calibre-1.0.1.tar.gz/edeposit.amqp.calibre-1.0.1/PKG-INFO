Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This module provides wrapper for Calibre, to access itâ€™s conversion functions using AMQP protocol.
        
        Module provides only generic wrapper, not AMQP communication itself - that is handled by Calibredaemon from edeposit.amqp project.
        
        `Full module documentation <http://edeposit-amqp-calibre.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ is hosted at the ReadTheDocs.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Package can be installed using `PIP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_%28package_manager%29>`_:
        
        ::
        
           pip install edeposit.amqp.calibre
        
        Source codes are located at `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_: https://github.com/jstavel/edeposit.amqp.calibre.
        
        
        Acceptance tests
        ----------------
        
        `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org/>`__ is used to test the sources, which are stored in ``src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests`` directory.
        
        You can run them manually (from the root of the package):
        
        ::
        
            $ pybot -W 80 --pythonpath src/edeposit/amqp/calibre/tests/:src src/edeposit/amqp/calibre/tests/
        
        Or continuously using nosier:
        
        ::
        
            $ nosier -p src -b 'export' "pybot -W 80 --pythonpath src/edeposit/amqp/calibre/tests/ --pythonpath src src/edeposit/amqp/calibre/tests/"
        
        .. Status of acceptance tests
        .. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        .. You can see the results of the tests here:

        .. http://edeposit-amqp-calibre.readthedocs.org/cs/latest/\_downloads/report.html
        
        .. Results are currently (12.03.2014) outdated, but some form of continuous integration framework will be used in the future.
