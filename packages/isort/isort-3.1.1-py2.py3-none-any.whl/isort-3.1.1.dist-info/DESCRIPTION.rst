isort your python imports for you so you don't have to.

isort is a Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and
automatically separated into sections. It provides a command line
utility, Python library, Vim plugin, Sublime plugin, and Kate plugin to
quickly sort all your imports.

Before isort:

::

    from my_lib import Object

    print("Hey")

    import os

    from my_lib import Object3

    from my_lib import Object2

    import sys

    from third_party import lib15, lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4, lib5, lib6, lib7, lib8, lib9, lib10, lib11, lib12, lib13, lib14

    import sys

    from __future__ import absolute_import

    from third_party import lib3

    print("yo")

After isort:

::

    from __future__ import absolute_import

    import os
    import sys

    from third_party import (lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4, lib5, lib6, lib7, lib8,
                             lib9, lib10, lib11, lib12, lib13, lib14, lib15)

    from my_lib import Object, Object2, Object3

    print("Hey")
    print("yo")

Installing isort
================

Installing isort is as simple as:

::

    pip install isort

or if you prefer

::

    easy_install isort

Using isort
===========

from the command line:

::

    isort mypythonfile.py mypythonfile2.py

or to see the proposed changes without applying them

::

    isort mypythonfile.py --diff

from within Python:

::

    from isort import SortImports

    SortImports("pythonfile.py")

or

::

    from isort import SortImports

    new_contents = SortImports(file_contents=old_contents).output

from within Kate:

::

    ctrl+[

or

::

    menu > Python > Sort Imports

Installing isort's Kate plugin
==============================

To install the kate plugin you must either have pate installed or the
very latest version of Kate:

::

    wget https://raw.github.com/timothycrosley/isort/master/isort_kate_plugin.py --output-document ~/.kde/share/apps/kate/pate/isort_plugin.py

You will then need to restart kate and enable Python Plugins as well as
the isort plugin itself.

Installing isort's Vim plugin
=============================

The Vim plugin for isort is maintained by @fisadev with installation
directions located on the dedicated vim-isort repository here:
https://github.com/fisadev/vim-isort#installation

Installing isort's Sublime plugin
=================================

The sublime plugin for isort is maintained by @thijsdezoete with
installation directions located on the dedicated
sublime-text-isort-plugin repository here:
https://github.com/thijsdezoete/sublime-text-isort-plugin#install

Plugins for other text editors
==============================

I use Kate, and Kate provides a very nice Python plugin API so I wrote a
Kate plugin. That said I will enthusiastically accept pull requests that
include plugins for other text editors and add documentation for them as
I am notified.

How does isort work?
====================

isort parses specified files for global level import lines (imports
outside of try / excepts blocks, functions, etc..) and puts them all at
the top of the file grouped together by the type of import:

-  Future
-  Python Standard Library
-  Third Party
-  Current Python Project
-  Explicitly Local (. before import, as in: from . import x)
-  Custom Separate Sections (Defined by forced\_separate list in
   configuration file)

Inside of each section the imports are sorted alphabetically. isort
automatically removes duplicate python imports, and wraps long from
imports to the specified line length (defaults to 80).

When will isort not work?
=========================

If you ever have the situation where you need to have a try / except
block in the middle of top-level imports or if your import order is
directly linked to precedence.

For example: a common practice in Django settings files is importing \*
from various settings files to form a new settings file. In this case if
any of the imports change order you are changing the settings definition
itself.

However, you can configure isort to skip over just these files - or even
to force certain imports to the top.

Configuring isort
=================

If you find the default isort settings do not work well for your
project, isort provides several ways to adjust the behavior.

To configure isort for a single user create a ~/.isort.cfg file:

::

    [settings]
    line_length=120
    force_to_top=file1.py,file2.py
    skip=file3.py,file4.py
    known_standard_libary=std,std2
    known_third_party=randomthirdparty
    known_first_party=mylib1,mylib2
    indent='    '
    multi_line_output=3
    length_sort=1
    forced_separate=django.contrib,django.utils
    default_section=FIRSTPARTY

Additionally, you can specify project level configuration simply by
placing a .isort.cfg file at the root of your project. isort will look
up to 20 directories up, from the one it is ran, to find a project
specific configuration.

You can then override any of these settings by using command line
arguments, or by passing in override values to the SortImports class.

Finally, as of version 3.0 isort supports editorconfig files using the
standard syntax defined here: http://editorconfig.org/

You can also place any standard isort configuration parameters within an
editorconfig file under the \*.py section and they will be honored.

Multi line output modes
=======================

You will notice above the "multi\_line\_output" setting. This setting
defines how from imports wrap when they extend past the line\_length
limit and has 4 possible settings:

0 - Grid

::

    from third_party import (lib1, lib2, lib3,
                             lib4, lib5, ...)

1 - Vertical

::

    from third_party import (lib1,
                             lib2,
                             lib3
                             lib4,
                             lib5,
                             ...)

2 - Hanging Indent

::

    from third_party import \
        lib1, lib2, lib3, \
        lib4, lib5, lib6

3 - Vertical Hanging Indent

::

    from third_party import (
        lib1,
        lib2,
        lib3,
        lib4,
    )

4 - Hanging Grid

::

    from third_party import (
        lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4,
        lib5, ...)

5 - Hanging Grid Grouped

::

    from third_party import (
        lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4,
        lib5, ...
    )

Alternatively, you can set force\_single\_line to True (-sl on the
command line) and every import will appear on its own line

::

    from third_party import lib1
    from third_party import lib2
    from third_party import lib3
    ...

Note: to change the how constant indents appear - simply change the
indent property with the following accepted formats: \* Number of spaces
you would like. For example: 4 would cause standard 4 space indentation.
\* Tab \* A verbatim string with quotes around it. For example: " " is
equivalent to 4

Intelligently Balanced Multi-line Imports
=========================================

As of isort 3.1.0 support for balanced multi-line imports has been
added. With this enabled isort will dynamically change the import length
to the one that produces the most balanced grid, while staying below the
maximum import length defined.

Example:

::

    from __future__ import (absolute_import, division,
                            print_function, unicode_literals)

Will be produced instead of:

::

    from __future__ import (absolute_import, division, print_function,
                            unicode_literals)

To enable this set 'balanced\_wrapping' to True in your config or pass
the -e option into the command line utility.

Auto-comment import sections
============================

Some projects prefer to have import sections uniquely titled to aid in
identifying the sections quickly when visually scanning. isort can
automate this as well. To do this simply set the
import\_heading\_{section\_name} setting for each section you wish to
have auto commented - to the desired comment.

For Example:

::

    import_heading_stdlib=Standard Library
    import_heading_firstparty=My Stuff

Would lead to output looking like the following:

::

    # Standard Library
    import os
    import sys

    import django.settings

    # My Stuff
    import myproject.test

Ordering by import length
=========================

isort also makes it easy to sort your imports by length, simply by
setting the length\_sort option to True. This will result in the
following output style:

::

    from evn.util import (
        Pool,
        Dict,
        Options,
        Constant,
        DecayDict,
        UnexpectedCodePath,
    )

Skip processing of imports (outside of configuration)
=====================================================

To make isort ignore a single import simply add a comment at the end of
the import line containing the text 'isort:skip'

::

    import module  # isort:skip

or

::

    from xyz import (abc,  # isort:skip
                     yo,
                     hey)

To make isort skip an entire file simply add the following to the
modules doc string: 'isort:skip\_file'

::

    """ my_module.py
        Best module ever

       isort:skip_file
    """

    import b
    import a

Adding an import to multiple files
==================================

isort makes it easy to add an import statement across multiple files,
while being assured it's correctly placed.

from the command line:

::

    isort -a "from __future__ import print_function" *.py

from within Kate:

::

    ctrl+]

or:

::

    menu > Python > Add Import

Removing an import from multiple files
======================================

isort makes it easy to remove an import from multiple files, without
having to be concerned with how it was originally formatted

from the command line:

::

    isort -r "os.system" *.py

from within Kate:

::

    ctrl+shift+]

or:

::

    menu > Python > Remove Import

Using isort to verify code
==========================

isort can also be used to used to verify that code is correctly
formatted by running it with -c. Any files that contain incorrectly
sorted imports will be outputted to stderr.

::

    isort **/*.py -c

    SUCCESS: /home/timothy/Projects/Open_Source/isort/isort_kate_plugin.py Everything Looks Good! (stdout)
    ERROR: /home/timothy/Projects/Open_Source/isort/isort/isort.py Imports are incorrectly sorted. (stderr)

Why isort?
==========

isort simply stands for import sort. It was originally called
"sortImports" however I got tired of typing the extra characters and
came to the realization camelCase is not pythonic.

I wrote isort because in an organization I used to work in the manager
came in one day and decided all code must have alphabetically sorted
imports. The code base was huge - and he meant for us to do it by hand.
However, being a programmer - I'm too lazy to spend 8 hours mindlessly
performing a function, but not too lazy to spend 16 hours automating it.
I was given permission to open source sortImports and here we are :)

--------------

Thanks and I hope you find isort useful!
