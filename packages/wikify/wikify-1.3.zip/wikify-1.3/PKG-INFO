Description: **wikify** your texts!  
        *micro-framework for text wikification*
        
        goals - avoid conflicts between text modifications rules
                and be easy to extend and debug

        #### usage
        1. define rules that match and process parts of text
        2. text = wikify(text, rules)
        
        `rule` is a function or an object run() method that takes text and
        returns either `None` (means not matched) or this text split into
        three parts [ not-matched, processed, the-rest ]. `processed` part
        of text is returned modified by the rule.
        
        example of a rule in action:
        
            >>> import wikify
            >>> wikify.rule_link_wikify('wikify your texts!')
            ('', '<a href="https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/wikify/">wikify</a>', ' your texts!')
        
        and its source code:
        
            def rule_link_wikify(text):
              """ replace `wikify` text with a link to repository """
              if not 'wikify' in text:
                return None
              res = text.split('wikify', 1)
              site = 'https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/wikify/'
              url = '<a href="%s">wikify</a>' % site
              return (res[0], url, res[1])
        
        using the rule with wikify to get processed text:
        
            >>> from wikify import wikify, rule_link_wikify
            >>> wikify('wikify your texts!', rule_link_wikify)
            '<a href="https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/wikify/">wikify</a> your texts!'
        
        you probably want change url and searched string, so to avoid
        rewriting the rule from scratch, **wikify** provides some.
        
        
        #### API
        
        ###### RegexpRule(search, replace=r'\0')
        wikify rule class. `search` is regexp, `replace` can be string
        with backreferences (like \0, \1 etc.) or a callable that receives
        `re.MatchObject`.
        
            r = RegexpRule('(\d+)', '[\\1]')
            print(wikify('wrap list 1 2 3 45', r))
            # wrap list [1] [2] [3] [45]
        
        ###### tracker_link_rule(url)
        chained function rule (function that returns list of rules) that
        replaces references like #123, issue #123 with link to `url` with
        issue number appended.
        
            w = tracker_link_rule('https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/wikify/issue/')
            print(wikify('issue #123, &#8121;', w))
            # <a href="https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/wikify/issue/123">issue #123</a>, &#8121;
        
        ###### wikify(text, rules)
        `rules` argument can be a list of rules. **wikify** ensures that text
        processed by one rule is not reachable by others. if you try to process
        some text without **wikify** with just a series of replacement commands,
        there can be situations when later replacement may affect the text just
        pasted by previous one. **wikify** was made to prevent this from
        happening.
        
        
        #### using as a Sphinx extension
        **wikify** is also a Sphinx extension. the following lines if added
        to `conf.py`, will link issue numbers on `changes` page to bugtracker for
        the `sphinx` project:
        
            extensions = ['wikify']
        
            # setup wikify extension to convert issue references to links
            from wikify import RegexpRule, tracker_link_rule
            wikify_html_rules = [
                # PR#123 or pull request #123
                RegexpRule('(PR|pull request\s)\s*#(\d+)',
                    '<a href="https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/pull-request/\\2">\\0</a>'),
                # issue #123 or just #123
                tracker_link_rule('https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/')
            ]
            wikify_html_pages = ['changes']
        
        
        #### operation (flat algorithm)
        for each region
          - find region in processed text
          - process text matched by region
          - exclude processed text from further processing
        
        note: (flat algorithm) doesn't process nested markup,
        such as:
        
            *`bold preformatted text`*
        
        example - replace all wiki:something with HTML links
          - [x] wrap text into list with single item
          - [x] split text into three parts using regexp `wiki:\w+`
          - [x] copy 1st part (not-matched) into the resulting list
          - [x] replace matched part with link, insert (processed)
            into the resulting list
          - [ ] process (the-rest) until text list doesn't change
          - [x] repeat the above for the rest of rules, skipping
            (processed) parts
          - [x] reassemble text from the list
        
        
        #### roadmap
        - [ ] optimize - measure perfomance of using indexes
            instead of text chunks
        - [x] write docs
        - [ ] upload to PyPI
        
        
        #### history
        - 1.3  - create_tracker_link_rule to tracker_link_rule
        - 1.2  - convert create_regexp_rule to RegexpRule class
        - 1.1  - allow rules to be classes (necessary for Sphinx)
        - 1.0  - use wikify as Sphinx extension
        
        - 0.9  - case insensitive match in tracker link rule
        - 0.8  - python 3 compatibility
        - 0.7  - fixed major flaw in text replacements mapping
        - 0.5  - helper to build rules to link tracker references
        - 0.6  - flatten nested rule lists
        - 0.4  - accept single rule in wikify in addition to list
        - 0.3  - allow callables in replacements for regexp rules
        - 0.2  - helper to build regexp based rules
        - 0.1  - proof of concept, production ready, no API sugar and optimizations
