The aim of this project is to bring better localization process for Django Suit (http://djangosuit.com/).

What i have done
----------------

* generated suit locale files
* compared with ``django.contrib.admin`` locale files and removed duplicates
* compared with the supported packages and removed duplicates
* left the translations that do not maintain their own translation process
* left the translations that are from maintained packages but i did not found them
