        Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a responsive replacement for the
        ``plone.global_sections`` viewlet. But note that just installing this
        theme in itself does not replace anything. You will have to adjust
        your theme to make use of this package.
        
        Set up edition1.menu in your theme product
        ------------------------------------------
        
        Add the package as dependency to you theme product. To do so add edition1.menu to the section install_requires in your setup.py::
        
             install_requires=[
                  'setuptools',
                  # -*- Extra requirements: -*-
                  'edition1.menu',
              ],
        
        
        Next, add edition1.menu to your metadata.xml::
        
            <dependencies>
               <dependency>profile-edition1.menu:default</dependency>
            </dependencies>
        
        Run your buildout.
        
        Next you need to add the viewlet to your browser configure.zcml::
        
            <!-- Responsive menu -->
            <browser:viewlet
              name="edition1.menu.responsive"
              manager="plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IPortalHeader"
              class="edition1.menu.viewlets.menu.MenuViewlet"
              layer=".interfaces.IThemeSpecific"
              permission="zope2.View"
            />
        
        Everything is in place. Now you have to hide the global.navigation viewlet, because you use the edition1 responsive menu instead::
        
            <order manager="plone.portalheader" skinname="Your Theme" purge="True">
               <viewlet name="plone.global_sections" remove="true" />
            </order>
        
            <hidden manager="plone.portalheader" skinname="Your Theme">
               <viewlet name="plone.global_sections" />
            </hidden>
        
        
        Start up your instance and go to plone control panel/Add-ons. Install edition1.menu. Go back to control panel and click on "Menu settings" in the section Add-on Configuration. You can configure the minimal width of the wide menu, navigation tree depth and maximal number of items in wide menu.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.1a7 (2013-12-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Add 'parent' and 'current' classes to <li> tags of the menu. [maciekz]
        
        
        0.1a6 (2013-11-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix error when actions are in the menu (like the Home item) that
          have no children.
          [markvl]
        
        
        0.1a5 (2012-11-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Load setMenuSize() in the template, instead of on document.ready.
          Otherwise you will see the menu in the wrong layout before it is
          styled correctly. [mirella]
        
        
        0.1a4 (2012-11-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix the fix of the small menu. The small menu stopped working when
          it was expanded and the windows was resized from small to big and
          back again.
          [markvl]
        
        
        0.1a3 (2012-11-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Small fix where the small menu is expanded when the window is
          resized from big to small.
          [markvl]
        
        
        0.1a2 (2012-11-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Add a configuration option to always use the small menu when there
          are more than X menu items. (So we can prevent overflowing the menu
          even on 'desktop' screens.)
          [markvl]
        
        - Make the small version of the menu work: start with children
          collapsed (hidden) and expand (visible) when needed. First click
          expands, second click collapses.
          [markvl]
        
        - Use a class to mark that a menu item has children. (And remove the
          hard coded greater than sign.)
          [markvl]
        
        - Remove duplication from the menu templates by moving the complete
          <ul> structure to the menu_recurse template.
          [markvl]
        
        
        0.1a1 (2012-11-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Package created using templer
