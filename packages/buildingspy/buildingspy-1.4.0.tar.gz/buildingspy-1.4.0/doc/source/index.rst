buildingspy
===========

*buildingspy* is a `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ 
package that can be used 

 - to run Modelica simulations using
   `Dymola <http://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/capabilities/systems-engineering/modelica-systems-simulation/dymola>`_,
 - to process ``*.mat`` output files that were generated by 
   Dymola or 
   `OpenModelica <https://www.openmodelica.org/>`_, and
 - to run unit tests as part of the library development.

The package provides functions
to extract data series from the output file for 
further use in the python packages 
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
for plotting and
`SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ for scientific computing.
