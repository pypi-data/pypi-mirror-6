Description: Restore System Python's ability to compile extensions,
        which has been broken on OS X 10.9 with Xcode 5.1.
        
        System Python has a compile flag `-mno-fused-madd`,
        which is unrecognized by clang.
        Xcode 5.1 updates clang to a version that promotes this warning to an error,
        making it impossible to compile any extensions on System Python after installing Xcode 5.1.
        
        This patches /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/_sysconfigdata.py
        to remove any instances of `-mno-fused-madd`.
        
        Since it modifies system files, this is probably a horrible thing to do, and nobody should use it.
        But here it is anyway, use at your own risk.
