Description: ================
        Template-Timings
        ================
        
        Template-timings is a panel for Django Debug Toolbar that gives an in-dept breakdown of the time it takes to render your Django templates (including templates included via {% extends %} and {% include %}).
        
        
        Install
        =======
        
        Install via pip (pip install django-debug-toolbar-template-timings) then add 'template_timings_panel.panels.TemplateTimings.TemplateTimings' to your DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS setting, and add 'template_timings_panel' to your INSTALLED_APPS::
        
            DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS = [
                ...
                'template_timings_panel.panels.TemplateTimings.TemplateTimings',
            ]
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'template_timings_panel'
            ]
        
        
        FAQ
        ===
        
        **How much overhead does this add?**
        
        In my experience this panel adds about 10% overhead. The panel uses the standard SQLPanel that ships with debug-toolbar to handle the SQL timings, so if you disable that the overhead will decrease and you can still see the render times.
        
        **The SQL count is different from the SQLPanel?**
        
        SQLPanel counts **all** queries that are executed, wherease this panel only counts queries that are executed while rendering a template.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        Configuration is optional. There is currently only one setting you can configure (the values below are the default)::
        
            IGNORED_TEMPLATES = ["debug_toolbar/*"] # Ignore these templates from the output
Platform: UNKNOWN
