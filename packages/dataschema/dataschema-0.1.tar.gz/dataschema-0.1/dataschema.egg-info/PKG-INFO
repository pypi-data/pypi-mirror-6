Description: Schema validation for Python data structures
        ============================================
        
        Basic validation for Python data structures in a mostly declarative
        form (there is an escape hatch in "extraValidation" callables).
        
        Validation errors are reported as both a path within the data
        structure (sequence of indices or keys) and a descriptive message
        (string).
        
        Typical usage::
        
            data = json.load(some_file) # or pickle, or ...
            errors = dataschema.Validator(my_schema).validate(data)
            if errors:
                for path, message in errors:
                    # Report error `message` at path `path`.
            else:
                # Any data access or application-specific validation can now
                # rely on properties of my_schema (e.g. minimum number of
                # elements in a sequence, data types of elements, presence of
                # certain keys in a dict, etc.).
        
        See the unit tests for schema examples.
        
        There are a few limitations (only string keys for any dictionaries in
        data) and a more fully Pythonic validator might focus on interfaces
        and abstract base classes over concrete types.  However, dataschema is
        a great improvement over ad hoc validation code for many uses today.
