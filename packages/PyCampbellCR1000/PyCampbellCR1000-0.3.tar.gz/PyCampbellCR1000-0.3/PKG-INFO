Description: PyCampbellCR1000 : Query the Campbell CR1000-type Dataloggers
        =============================================================
        
        PyCampbellCR1000 is a python project which aims to allow the communication with
        Campbell CR1000 Type Datalogger
        
        The main features include automatic collecting of data and settings (read only)
        as a list of dictionnaries.
        
        The tool can be used in your python scripts for data post-processing,
        or in command line mode to collect data as CSV.
        
        We don't update anything from PyCampbellCR1000 besides time,
        because we are assuming that the dataloggers are already configured.
        
        **Note:** PyCampbellCR1000 uses the `PyLink <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyLink>`_ lib, offers a universal communication interface with File-Like API.
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        We init communication by giving the datalogger URL.
        
        
        ::
        
          >>> from pycampbellcr1000 import CR1000
          >>> device = CR1000.from_url('tcp:host-ip:port')
          >>> # or with Serial connection
          >>> device = CR1000.from_url('serial:/dev/ttyUSB0:38400')
        
        To get time, use:
        
        ::
        
          >>> device.gettime()
          datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 16, 12, 27, 55)
        
        To get data, you have to enter the table name where it is stored.
        If you don't know the table name, you cannot collect the list of available
        tables in the datalogger.
        
        
        ::
        
          >>> device.list_tables()
          ['Status', 'Table1', 'Public']
        
        Choose the time period to get your data from `start date` to `stop date`.
        
        
        ::
        
          >>> import datetime
          >>> start = datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 16, 11, 0, 0)
          >>> stop = datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 16, 12, 0, 0)
          >>> data = device.get_data('Table1', start, stop)
          >>> data[0]["Datetime"]
          datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 16, 11, 0)
        
        ::
        
          >>> data[0]["CurSensor1_mVolt_Avg"]
          2508.0
        
        ::
        
          >>> print(data.filter(('Datetime', 'CurSensor3_mAmp_Avg')).to_csv())
          Datetime,CurSensor3_mAmp_Avg
          2012-07-16 11:00:00,18.7
          2012-07-16 11:01:00,18.48
          ...
