=====================
rfw - remote firewall
=====================

Remote firewall as a web service.
 
``rfw`` is the RESTful server which applies iptables rules to block or allow IP addresses on request from a remote client. ``rfw`` maintains the list of blocked IP addresses which may be updated on the fly from many sources. ``rfw`` also solves the problem of concurrent modifications to iptables since the requests are serialized.

Typical use cases
-----------------

1. You manage a group of machines which are deployed/controlled/monitored from a central server or admin panel. You need to react quickly/automatically to abuse/DDOS with the rules generated by the intelligence/analytics/geolocation-aware server. You push the IP blocklist updates to other machines in real time.
