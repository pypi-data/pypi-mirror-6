.SH NAME
get_url \- Downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP to node
.\" ------ DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP to the remote server. The remote server \fImust\fR have direct access to the remote resource. 
.PP
By default, if an environment variable \fC<protocol>_proxy\fR is set on the target host, requests will be sent through that proxy. This behaviour can be overridden by setting a variable for this task (see `setting the environment <http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/playbooks_environment.html#setting-the-environment-and-working-with-proxies>`_), or by using the use_proxy option. 
.\" ------ OPTIONS
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
   
.IP dest
absolute path of where to download the file to.If \fCdest\fR is a directory, either the server provided filename or, if none provided, the base name of the URL on the remote server will be used. If a directory, \fCforce\fR has no effect.(required)   
.IP force
If \fCyes\fR and \fCdest\fR is not a directory, will download the file every time and replace the file if the contents change. If \fCno\fR, the file will only be downloaded if the destination does not exist. Generally should be \fCyes\fR only for small local files. Prior to 0.6, this module behaved as if \fCyes\fR was the default. Has no effect if \fCdest\fR is a directory - the file will always be downloaded, but replaced only if the contents changed.
.IR Choices :
yes,no. (default: no)(Added in Ansible version 0.7.)
   
.IP others
all arguments accepted by the \fIfile\fR module also work here   
.IP sha256sum
If a SHA-256 checksum is passed to this parameter, the digest of the destination file will be calculated after it is downloaded to ensure its integrity and verify that the transfer completed successfully.(Added in Ansible version 1.3.)
   
.IP url
HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL in the form (http|https|ftp)://[user[:pass]]@host.domain[:port]/path(required)   
.IP use_proxy
if \fCno\fR, it will not use a proxy, even if one is defined in an environment variable on the target hosts.
.IR Choices :
yes,no. (default: yes).\"
