Description: Physical Optics Propagation in PYthon (POPPY)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        This module implements an object-oriented system for modeling physical optics propagation with diffraction, particularly for multiwavelength simulations of telescopic and coronagraphic imaging. 
        
        Right now only far-field diffraction (Fraunhofer regime) between image and pupil planes is supported; Fresnel propagation and intermediate planes are a future goal.
        
        Developed by Marshall Perrin at STScI, 2010-2014, for use simulating the James Webb Space Telescope.
