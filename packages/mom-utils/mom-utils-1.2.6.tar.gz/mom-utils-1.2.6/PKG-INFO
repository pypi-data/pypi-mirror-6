Description: mom-utils
        =========
        
        
        This is a collection of Python utilities for the MOM, a numerical model
        developed by GFDL/NOAA
        
        
        Support and Documentation
        -------------------------
        
        Quick howto use
        ---------------
        
        To install:
        
            pip install mom-utils
        
        Some uses:
        
        * The input.nml do not require any order, so it is usually not fun to compare two different input.nml. This command is different then a regular diff, since it doesn't care about the order of the variables. The output show what is different, or what is defined in only one of the files.
        
            mom_namelist compare input.nml input2.nml
        
        * Inside python, one can read an input.nml setup, change one parameter, and write into another input2.nml like this:
        
            nml_text = open('input.nml', 'r').read()
        
            cfg = mom_utils.nml_decode(nml_text)
        
            cfg['ocean_model_nml']['dt_ocean'] = 7200
        
            output = open('input2.nml', 'w')
        
            output.write(mom_utils.yaml2nml(cfg))
        
        * Some namelists/parameters changed or disapear between MOM4 and MOM5. The task "check" evaluates if all namelists/parameters in the input.nml are declared in the code.
        
            mom_namelist check --momsrc=mom/src myexperiments/exp1/input.nml
        
        * Task 4to5 converts a namelist for MOM4 to a namelist for MOM5
        
            mom_namelist 4to5 input.nml > ./input.nml.new

        1.2.4
        -----
        
        * Temporary solution to allow to handle input.nml for CM, which store some lists as parameters values.
        
        1.2
        ---
        
        * mom4_namelist renamed to mom_namelist.
        
        * New task "check" for mom_namelist.
        
        before 1.1.4
        ------------
        
        * mom4_namelist: An application to parse and manipulate the input.nml
        * Including some documentation
        * First release was some point at 2011, I'm not sure when.
