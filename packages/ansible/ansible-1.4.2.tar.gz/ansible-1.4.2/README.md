Ansible
=======

Ansible is a radically simple configuration-management, deployment, task-execution, and
multinode orchestration framework.

Many users run straight from the development branch (it's generally fine to do so), but you might also wish to consume a release.  You can find 
instructions [here](http://ansibleworks.com/docs/intro_getting_started.html) for a variety of platforms.  If you want a tarball of the last release, go to 
http://ansibleworks.com/releases/ and you can also install with pip.

Design Principles
=================

   * Dead simple setup
   * Super fast & parallel by default
   * No server or client daemons; use existing SSHd
   * No additional software required on client boxes
   * Modules can be written in ANY language
   * Awesome API for creating very powerful distributed scripts
   * Be usable as non-root
   * The easiest config management system to use, ever.

Get Involved
============

   * Read [Contributing.md](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/CONTRIBUTING.md) for all kinds of ways to contribute to and interact with the project, including mailing list information and how to submit bug reports and code to Ansible.
   * irc.freenode.net: #ansible

Branch Info
===========

   * Releases are named after Van Halen songs.
   * The devel branch corresponds to the release actively under development.
   * Various release-X.Y branches exist for previous releases
   * We'd love to have your contributions, read "CONTRIBUTING.md" for process notes.
