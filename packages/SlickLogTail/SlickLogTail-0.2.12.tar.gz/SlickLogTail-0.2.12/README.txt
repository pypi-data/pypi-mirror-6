SlickLogTail
============

SlickLogTail is a Python tool which works like the tail unix command.
It reads the appended data to a log file and transfers it to the SlickLog.com platform.
SlickLogTail is able to detect if a log file is rotated, in that case it starts reading
the data from the new rotated log file.
See `SlickLog Developers Documentation <http://slicklog.com/documentation>`_
for more info.
