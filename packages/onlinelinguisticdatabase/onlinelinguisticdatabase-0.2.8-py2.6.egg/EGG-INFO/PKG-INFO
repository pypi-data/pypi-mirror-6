        A web application for structuring, processing and sharing linguistic fieldwork
        data.  The app is multi-user with authorization and authentication
        functionality.  The intent is that groups of researchers studying a common
        language will download the Online Linguistic Database (OLD), install it on their
        own server and use it to create an online repository of linguistic data for
        their language of study.  
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        First install Easy Install if you don't have it already by downloading
        ``ez_setup.py`` from http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py and
        installing it like this::
        
            python ez_setup.py
        
        Now install OnlineLinguisticDatabase like this::
        
            easy_install OnlineLinguisticDatabase
            paster make-config "OnlineLinguisticDatabase==0.2.8" production.ini
        
        Configure the application by editing the ``production.ini`` config file just
        created.
        
        Alter database defaults using the format described at
        http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/05/dbengine.html#dbengine_supported.
        
        The default RDBMS is MySQL.  With no alterations to production.ini, the system
        will expect a MySQL database named 'old' and a user (username: 'old', password:
        'old') who has full permissions on the 'old' database.  If this database and
        user do not exist, the default OLD set up will fail.  Best bet is to change the
        production.ini file to suite your own (secure) MySQL configuration.
        
        To use a SQLite database, comment out the MySQL option and uncomment the SQLite
        option::
        
            # MySQL OPTION
            #sqlalchemy.url = mysql://old:old@localhost:3306/old
            #sqlalchemy.pool_recycle = 3600
            # SQLite OPTION
            sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///%(here)s/old.db
        
        This will create a SQLite database file called 'old.db' in the same directory as
        your production.ini file.
        
        Set up the OLD application and serve it::
        
            paster setup-app production.ini
            paster serve production.ini
        
        The running application will now be available at http://localhost/
