Description: from odictliteral import odict
        ==============================
        
        Provides a nice way of specifying ordered dictionaries from Python source.
        
        Example:
        
            >>> from odictliteral import odict
            >>> x = odict[1:2,3:4]
            >>> print(x)
            odict[1: 2, 3: 4]
        
        You can use odict as a replacement for OrderedDict otherwise, eg:
        
            >>> y = odict( [(1,2), (3,4)] )
            >>> print(y)
            odict[1: 2, 3: 4]
            >>> x == y
            True
        
        You should also be able to use odict in combination with OrderedDicts:
        
            >>> z = OrderedDict( [(1,2), (3,4)] )
            >>> print(z)
            OrderedDict([(1, 2), (3, 4)])
            >>> y == z
            True
        
        That's pretty much all there is to it. Should be compatible with Python
        2.7 and Python 3; requires the "ordereddict" module to work with Python
        2.4, 2.5 or 2.6.
