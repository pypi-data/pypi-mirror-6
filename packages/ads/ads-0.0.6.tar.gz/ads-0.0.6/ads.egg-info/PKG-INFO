Description: **A Python module to interact with NASA's ADS that doesn't suckâ„¢**
        ==================================================================
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andycasey/ads-python.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andycasey/ads-python)
        
        If you're in research, then you pretty much _need_ NASA's ADS. It's tried, true, and on the rare occasions when it goes down, people go crazy.
        
        I wanted some way to be able to easily search ADS from the terminal, and a mate wanted a way to make visualisations from all the ADS data. So I've written this module to use the new API from NASA ADS. Hooray!
        
        **First Steps**
        
        1. You'll need a developer API key from NASA ADS labs first.
        
        2. When you get your developer API, save it to a file called ``~/.ads/dev_key``
        
        3. Happy hacking.
        
        
        I'll put some examples and visualisations up here when I can.
