======================

Websockets for Django applications using Redis as message queue
---------------------------------------------------------------

This module implements websockets on top of Django without requiring any additional framework. For
messaging it uses the [Redis](http://redis.io/) datastore and in a production environment, it is
intended to work under [uWSGI](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/) and behind [NGiNX](http://nginx.com/).

You can find detailed documentation on [ReadTheDocs](http://django-websocket-redis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

Features
--------
* Largely scalable for Django applications with hundreds of open websocket connections.
* Runs in a cooperative concurrency model, thus only one thread/process is simultaneously required
  to control **all** open websockets.
* Full control over the main loop during development, so **Django** can be started as usual with
  ``./manage.py runserver``.
* No dependencies to any other asynchronous event driven framework, such as Tornado, Flask or Node.js.
* The only additional requirement is a running instance of **Redis**, which by the way is a good
  replacement for memcached.

Build status
------------
Currently, unit tests require a running Redis datastore, therefore they hav to run locally and can't
be deployed on Travis-CI.
