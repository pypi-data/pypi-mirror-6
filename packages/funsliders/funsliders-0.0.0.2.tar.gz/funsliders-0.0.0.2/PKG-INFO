Description: FunSliders
        ==========
        
        FunSliders is a simple GUI to manually explore the inputs of a function:
        
            from funsliders import funsliders
            def volume(x,y,z):
                return x*y*z
            funsliders(volume, [('x',0,5), ('y',1,5,3), ('z',2,5,4)])
        
        ![Alt text](https://raw.github.com/Zulko/funsliders/master/funsliders_demo.jpeg "Screenshot")
        
        A slightly more spectacular example of `funslider` in action is shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z82OHpw1-Qo).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        First solution, with pip:
        
            sudo pip install funsliders
        
        Second solution, unzip everything in a folder and go with
        
            sudo python setup.py develop
        
        Last solution, since it's a very small module (less than 100 lines) just copy the file `funsliders.py` or its content anywhere you want to use it.
        
        
        What else there is to know:
        ---------------------------
        
        The function to explore can be any function with numerical inputs.
        
        One can also define the slider's properties using a dictionnary.
        See Matplotlib's sliders for all supported arguments:
        
            funsliders(volume,[ {'label': 'x', 'valmin':1, 'valmax':5},
                         {'label': 'y', 'valmin':1, 'valmax':5, 'valinit':2},
                         {'label': 'z', 'valmin':1 , 'valmax':5} ])    
            
        `funsliders` has two other arguments:
        - `autoexec` is True, the function `f` is executed every time
        the sliders are changed, using the argument values indicated by the
        sliders. If `autoexec` is False, `f` is only run when the user presses `Enter`.
        - If `history` is True, the current value of all arguments is printed to
        the console every time the function `f` is run.
