        ## Interactive Mode
        
        If called without arguments, *gxmail* will run in interactive mode.
        
        ## Batch mode 
        
            [-b FILE.TXT --batch FILE.TXT]
        In batch mode, *gxmail* will read a list recepients from a text file.
        *Notes:*
        * The file must be plain text and contain one email per line
        * *batch mode* is NOT compatible with *interactive mode*, you must provide arguments: to, subject, and message. Only the profile may be ommitted, in which case, the default profile is used.
        
        *Spam is illegal, and it means you are evil if you use this software for that purpose.*

        mkdir ~/.gxmail
        ```
        
        * Make sure *gxmail.py* is executable

        ```
        ./gxmail.py
        ```
        
        # Profiles
        
        ## First Run
        When you first run *gxmail.py* it will prompt you to create your default profile:
        ```
         You don't have a profile set up yet. Let's do it now!
         Server -> smtp.mydomain.com
         Port -> 25
         Your email -> myemail@mydomain.com
         Your password -> myPa$$w0rd
         You are ready to send emails with your new profile!
        ```
        ## Profile Management
        Each profile is stored as a text file inside *~/.gxmail*
        You can simply delete each file to remove a profile.
        It is also posible to edit them with your favorite text editor, just remember to keep the structure:
        
            ["Profilename", "server", "port", "email", "password"]
        
        Example:
        
            ["default", "smtp.mydomain.com", "25", "myemail@mydomain.com", "myPa$$w0rd"]
