Introduction
============

This product defines new PAS plugins. The plugins may be used for membership
approval process. As soon as this package is installed and plugins activated
(plugins are activated automatically after installation), any new site member
has to be approved. All existing site member will be automatically approved on
the first product installation (if this plugin does not exist in acl_users, it
is considered as first installation).

This package does not provide any user interface for the approval process. If
you want it (you probably want), look at collective.memberapproval.
