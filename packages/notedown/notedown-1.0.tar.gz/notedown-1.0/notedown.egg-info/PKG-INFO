Description: Convert markdown to IPython Notebook
        ====================================
        
        
        This is a simple tool to convert markdown with code into an IPython
        Notebook.
        
        Usage:
        
            notedown input.md > output.ipynb
        
        
        It is really simple and separates your markdown into code and not
        code. Code goes into code cells, not-code goes into markdown cells.
        Currently only works with Github Flavored Markdown.
        
        Installation:
        
            pip install notedown
        
        
        ### Why?
        
        I don't know. Maybe you prefer writing in markdown.
        
        
        ### What this does **not** do:
        
        - run code cells
        - embed figures
        
        
        ### Conversion from notebook to markdown
        
        Converting from an IPython notebook to markdown is done using
        `nbconvert`:
        
            ipython nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to markdown
        
        
        ### TODO
        
        - [ ] support more markdowns
        - [ ] allow other cell types?
