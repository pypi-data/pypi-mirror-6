        pyramid_scss

        Overview
        ============
        This module provides a convenient bit of glue code around `pyScss <https://github.com/Kronuz/pyScss>`_, allowing your Pyramid projects to use stylesheets authored in `SCSS <http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html>`_. 
        
        Installation
        ============
        Install using setuptools, e.g. (within a virtualenv)::
        
            $ pip install pyramid_scss
        
        Or if you prefer to get the latest from Github::
        
            $ git clone git://github.com/jessedhillon/pyramid_scss.git
        
        Configuration
        ===============
        The only setting which is necessary is ``asset_path`` which is an asset spec which points to the root folder where your SCSS stylesheets are. An easy way to set that is to add this line to the ``[app:main]`` section of your ``project.ini``::
        
            scss.asset_path = myproject:assets/scss
        
        ``asset_path`` can be a newline delimited string of multiple asset paths. Each path will be searched, in order, until the matching stylesheet is found. An unmatched request will raise ``pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPNotFound``.
        
        ``static_path`` is a path to the static assets necessary to construct a stylesheet. Unlike ``asset_path``, this setting only accepts one path. ``static_url_root`` is required if you set ``static_path``, and it serves as a path prefix when generating the URL for a static resource.
        
        ``output_path`` is the path where generated assets will be output, such as spritemaps. Also, ``output_url_root`` is a required setting if ``output_path`` is provided, and will be prefix the path component of the URL generated in reference to compiled resources.
        
        There are a couple of other options. ``compress`` controls whether or not the output documents are compressed (all whitespace stripped)::
        
            scss.compress = false
        
        The other option is ``cache``, which will store both the contents of the file and the rendered output in memory::
        
            scss.cache = true
        
        Usage
        ===============
        First, use ``config.include`` to initialize the extension::
        
            config.include("pyramid_scss")
        
        Second, assuming you are using URL dispatch, add a route to serve css::
        
            config.add_route('css', '/css/{css_path:.*}.css')
            config.add_view(route_name='css', view='pyramid_scss.controller.get_scss', renderer='scss', request_method='GET')
        
        *TODO:* Add a traversal example.
        
        In the example above, an SCSS stylesheet located at ``myproject/assets/scss/style.scss`` (using the ``asset_path`` configured in the Configuration section) could be accessed by a URL request to ``http://myproject/css/style.css``. This route would also resolve stylesheets in subdirectories of ``asset_path``.
