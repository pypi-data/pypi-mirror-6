trapperkeeper
=============

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

TrapperKeeper is an SNMP trap daemon for ingesting and exposing traps.
*This is a work in progress and not ready for general consumption.*

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

New versions will be updated to PyPI pretty regularly so it should be as
easy as:

::

    pip install trapperkeeper
