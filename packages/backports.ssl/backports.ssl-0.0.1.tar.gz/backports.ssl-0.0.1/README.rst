backports.ssl

What is it?
-----------

It's the Python 3.4 standard `ssl` module API implemented on top of pyOpenSSL::

    import backports.ssl as ssl
    import socket

    context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
    context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED

    conn = context.wrap_socket(socket.socket(socket.AF_INET))
    conn.connect(('google.com', 443))
    print conn.getpeercert()
    conn.close()

Why?
----

Because the latest web technologies should be available to those running older
versions of Python.

Isn't this obsoleted by `PEP 466`_?
-----------------------------------

If you're on Python 2.7 and only want improved default security options, then
yes. But PEP 466 doesn't cover Python 2.6, 3.2, or 3.3, and new feature
enhancements, like NPN, ALPN, SNI, etc, are explicitly out of scope. This
package supports it all.

Why am I getting ``AttributeError``\ s for newer features?
------------------------------------------------------

Like the standard `ssl` module, certain attributes will not be available if your
OpenSSL does not support them. See `Installing OpenSSL`_ for instructions.

TODO
----

- Implement everything needed by urllib3.
- Monkey-patch ourselves into higher-level libraries like requests, without
  getting clobbered by gevent.
- Backport and pass the standard Python `ssl` test suite.
- Use the bundled 3.x OpenSSL, if available and newer than the default.
