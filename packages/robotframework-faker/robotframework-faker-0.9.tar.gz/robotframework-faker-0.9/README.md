robotframework-faker
====================

Robot Framework keyword library wrapper for [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker).

This module allows easy use of Faker's random test data generation in Robot Framework. I hate using static test data, because inevitably the system under test evolves to pass the tests without necessarily solving the root cause of bugs.

Any docstrings Faker provides are passed through to Robot Framework, so they're available in RIDE and in keyword documentation generated via libdoc.
