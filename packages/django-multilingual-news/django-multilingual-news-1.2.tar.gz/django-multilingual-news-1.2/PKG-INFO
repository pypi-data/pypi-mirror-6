Description: Django Multilingual News
        ========================
        
        A reusable Django app for managing news/blog entries in different languages.
        
        Comes with a django-cms apphook and has been prepared using Django 1.5.1 and
        django-cms 2.4.1.
        
        This app is based on the great https://github.com/fivethreeo/cmsplugin-blog
        and re-used some of it's snippets.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you want to install the latest stable release from PyPi::
        
            $ pip install django-multilingual-news
        
        If you feel adventurous and want to install the latest commit from GitHub::
        
            $ pip install -e git://github.com/bitmazk/django-multilingual-news.git#egg=multilingual_news
        
        Add ``multilingual_news`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...,
                'multilingual_news',
            )
        
        Run the South migrations::
        
            ./manage.py migrate multilingual_news
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Using the apphook
        +++++++++++++++++
        
        Simply create a django-cms page and select it in the ``Application`` field of
        the ``Advanced Settings``.
        
        Template tags
        -------------
        
        get_recent_news

        To render recent news::
