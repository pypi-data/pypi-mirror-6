geofeed-validator is a Python library which implements validation for self-published geofeeds as defined in
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-google-self-published-geofeeds-02.

Additionally to the library a sample CLI application is provided, which allows to validate geolocation feeds,
either located in the local filesystem, or downloaded from a remote host using urllib2.
