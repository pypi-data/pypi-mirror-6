Implementing Kernels
====================

Implementing an own kernel is easy. Just create a class which is derived from
:class:`.Kernel`. Then implement the :attr:`.Kernel.params` attribute and the
:meth:`.Kernel.full` method. Here is some example code to get you started::

    from goppy import Kernel

    class MyKernel(Kernel):
        def __init__(self, param1, param2):
            self.param1 = param1
            self.param2 = param2

        @property
        def params(self):
            return np.array([self.param1, self.param2])

        @params.setter
        def params(self, values):
            self.param1 = values[0]
            self.param2 = values[1]

        def full(x, y, what=('y',)):
            # Evaluate your kernel
            pass

By implementing :attr:`.Kernel.params` as a property it is possible to access
the parameters as an array (which is needed for evaluating log likelihood
derivatives of Gaussian processes), but also by more expressive names like
``k.param1``.

The :meth:`.Kernel.full` full method should by default evaluate the kernel
normally and return the result in a dictionary with the key ``'y'``. This is
sufficient for the basic functionality when used in conjunction with
:class:`.OnlineGP`. For more advanced usage involving predicting derivatives
:meth:`.Kernel.full` has also be able to return the derivatives of the kernel.
See the documentation of :meth:`.Kernel.full` for more information.

Sometimes only the diagonal of the Gram matrix is needed. The diagonal can
usually be calculated more efficiently than evaluating the full Gram matrix and
just using the diagonal. Thus, it might be a good idea to add
code for this special case by implementing :meth:`.Kernel.diag`.

some complete implementations of kernels.
