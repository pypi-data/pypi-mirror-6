INSTALL
==============================

Detailed instructions for installation of ARS and its requirements are available
in the online documentation [1].

ARS itself is really easy to install :) but some of its prerequisites
are not :( , depending on which operating system is used.
The best option is Ubuntu, specially its 12.04 (i.e. Precise Pangolin)
version. For that, follow the instructions in [2]. If you have another version
of Ubuntu, steps may be the same or very similar. For other Linux distros, the
steps regarding ``apt-get`` will probably change.

Microsoft Windows is the OS less friendly to ARS, as well as to many other open
source software. Nonetheless, it is very popular so we got it to run there too,
for both XP and 7 (Vista untested). Read the corresponding section in [3].

ARS has not been tested on Mac OSX but it should work fine because all the
required software has been reported to run fine on it. ARS itself is pure Python
and OS-agnostic thus possible issues will be related to the requirements [4].

Installation steps
------------------------------
(Note: only the "ars" package is part of the installation; docs, tests and
demos are not, although they are included in the archive file)

To install ARS , you need to:

1) check and install the requirements listed in the documentation.

2a) If you have pip installed, you only need one command to get the package from
the internet and install it in your system:
	$ pip install ARS

2b) If you don't have pip, open a command window, change the current directoy
to the project main directory and execute the (included) standard Python setup
script (you may need administrator privileges)
	$ cd ARS-03
	$ python setup.py install


Test installation
------------------------------
Start the Python interpreter (with the command "python")
	$ python
and import the package
	>>> import ars
You may explore the contents of the package with
	>>> help(ars)

If no errors appear, you are all set.
To exit the interpreter, use "quit()" or Ctrl+D.


Run demos
------------------------------
To watch ARS in action, run any file in the "demos" subdirectory, such as:
	$ python demos/FallingBall.py
	$ python demos/IROS/example4_sinusoidal_terrain.py


Build documentation
------------------------------
Sphinx is used to build the documentation. Most common output is HTML but a PDF
file can be generated through Latex. A makefile is included.
	$ docs/sphinx
	$ make html
	$ make latexpdf


Note: in the past, epydoc was used. It may still possible to generate the
documentation with it. For that, read the contents at docs/epydoc.
