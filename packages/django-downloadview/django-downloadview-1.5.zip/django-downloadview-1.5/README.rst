``django-downloadview`` makes it easy to serve files with Django:

* you manage files with Django (permissions, search, generation, ...);

* files are stored somewhere or generated somehow (local filesystem, remote
  storage, memory...);

* ``django-downloadview`` helps you stream the files with very little code;

* ``django-downloadview`` helps you improve performances with reverse proxies,
  via mechanisms such as Nginx's X-Accel.

Example
*******

Let's serve a file stored in a FileField of some model:

.. code:: python

   from django.conf.urls import url, url_patterns
   from django_downloadview import ObjectDownloadView
   from demoproject.download.models import Document  # A model with a FileField

   # ObjectDownloadView inherits from django.views.generic.BaseDetailView.
   download = ObjectDownloadView.as_view(model=Document, file_field='file')

   url_patterns = ('',
       url('^download/(?P<slug>[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/$', download, name='download'),
   )
