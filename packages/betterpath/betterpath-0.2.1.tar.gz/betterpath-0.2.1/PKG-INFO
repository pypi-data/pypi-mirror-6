Description: ==========
        betterpath
        ==========
        
        betterpath, or "bp", is an adaptation of the classic Twisted ``FilePath`` type
        and interface. bp provides a simple, robust, well-tested object abstraction
        over file paths, generalizing the concept of file paths beyond filesystems.
        
        File Paths
        ==========
        
        bp exposes an interface, `bp.abstract.IFilePath`, for file paths, and provides
        the following concrete implementations:
        
         * `bp.filepath.FilePath`, for the root filesystem
         * `bp.zippath.ZipPath`, for ZIP archives
         * `bp.memory.MemoryPath`, for in-memory temporary filesystems

        The Old Way
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            def save(base, fragments, data):
                # Unsafe either way; what if `fragments` contains ".."?
                path = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(base), os.sep.join(fragments))
                # path = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(base), *fragments)
                # I hope that this doesn't fail mid-write! Also, did the directories
                # exist? I think so, yes.
                with open(path, "wb") as handle:
                    handle.write(data)
        
        The New Way
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            def save(base, fragments, data):
                path = base.descendant(fragments)        
                path.parent().makeDirs()
                path.setContent(data)
