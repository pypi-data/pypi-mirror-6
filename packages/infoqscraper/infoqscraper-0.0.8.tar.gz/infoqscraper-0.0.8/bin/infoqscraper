Portable shebang wrapper for Python 2.

Some distro like Arch Linux link python to python3. Some other like Debian or
OS X do not have a python2 symlink. It makes almost impossible to start a
python2 using the shebang mechanism.

This wrapper use the python symlink and its code is compatible with python2 and
python3. If python3 is detected at runtime then it automaticaly switch to
python2.
