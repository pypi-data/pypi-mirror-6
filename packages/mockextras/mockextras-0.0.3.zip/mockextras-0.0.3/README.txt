The mockextras library is designed to be used with the mock library by Michael Foord 
(http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/). The mockextras library adds a number of features that
are found in other mocking libraries namely:

* a fluent API for the configuration of stubs
* stubs
* matchers

The egg is available in pypi here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mockextras
