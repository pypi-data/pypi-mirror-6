Change history for httpheader python module.

Version 1.1 released 2013-02-08

 * Bug fix. The 'ignore_wildcard' argument of the
   acceptable_content_type() function did not work properly when
   passed as True, as any content type of "*/*" would be ignored.

Version 1.0 released 2005-12-19

 * First public release.
