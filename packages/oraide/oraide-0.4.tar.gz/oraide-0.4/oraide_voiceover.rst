Oraide Screencast Script
########################

#. Live demos are a great way to impress an audience, but talking and typing at the same time is risky.
   [Show spoken word typing on screen.]

#. But replacing a live session with video makes it hard to control the pace of your presentation.
   [Show clicking play and pause, then moving the scrubber back.]

#. And compromises like screenshots or sample output just aren't as exciting.
   [Show pasting screenshots into Keynote.]

#. Oraide, with help from tmux, frees you from having to type and talk at the same time,
   while retaining the flair of a live demo, because it is a live demo.
   [Show starting a new tmux session on the left, and opening a Python file on the right.]

#. Just import Oraide…

#. …write your script… [Add a new step, typing ``Learn more at oraide.rtfd.org``.]

#. … and control all the action. [Save and close the file, then run it.]

#. Check out Oraide by reading the docs at oraide.rtfd.org.

#. It's also great for recording screencasts.
