Converting between table formats
================================

Orange Canvas has a "native" type for representing data tables, namely
*ExampleTable*. However, this type does not support Unicode well, which is
a serious limitation in the perspective of text processing. To overcome this
issue (as much as possible), Orange Textable defines its own table
representation format, simply called *Table*.

Every :doc:`table construction widget <table_construction_widgets>` in Orange
Textable emits data in *Table* format. Instances of these widget must then
be connected with an instance of :ref:`Convert`, which has mainly
two purposes:

    -   It *converts* data in Orange Textable's *Table* format to the native
        *ExampleTable* format of Orange Canvas, which makes it possible to
        use the other widgets of Orange Canvas for visualizing, modifying,
        analyzing, etc. tables built with Orange Textable.
        
    -   On demand, it *exports* data in *Table* format to text files, in
        tab-delimited format, typically in order to import them later in a
        third-party data analysis software package; at the time of writing,
        this scenario is the only way to correctly visualize a table
        containing data encoded in Unicode.
        
As shown on :ref:`figure 1 <converting_table_formats_fig1>` below, section
**Conversion** of the widget's interface lets the user choose the encoding
of the *ExampleTable* object produced in output (**Orange table encoding**);
variants of Unicode should be avoided here since they are currently not well
supported by other widgets in Orange Canvas.

The encoding for text file export can be selected in the **Export** section
(**Output file encoding**); in this case there are no counter-indications to
the use of Unicode. Checkbox **Include Orange headers** triggers inclusion of
additional table headers in the case where the output file should be later
re-imported in Orange Canvas. Export proper is performed by clicking the
**Export** button and selecting the output file in the dialog that appears.

The take-home message here is this: when you create an instance of a
:doc:`table construction widget <table_construction_widgets>`, you may
systematically create a new instance of :ref:`Convert` and connect
them together. Usually, moreover, you will want to connect the
:ref:`Convert` instance to a *Data Table* instance (from the *Data*
tab of Orange Canvas) in order to view the table just built--except in the
case where it contains Unicode data that wouldn't display correctly in
*Data table*.
