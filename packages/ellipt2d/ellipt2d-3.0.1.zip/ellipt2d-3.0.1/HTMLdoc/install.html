<P> Before installing ELLIPT2D you need to have 
<A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python 2.2</A> or later, installed with Tkinter activated. 
On windows this is automatic as Python is is bundled with Tkinter and the Tcl/Tk DLLs. However, 
when installing Python on UNIX you need to make sure that 
the lines near _tkinter in Modules/Setup are commented out before installation
 (more on how to activate Tkinter can be found in the INSTALL file part of the Python source
distribution). Also make
sure to have Python.h available for instance under /usr/local/include/python*. (Some 
Linux Python distributions only provide executables and libraries.)

<P> 
The "freshest" version of ELLIPT2D is always available via the CVS repository <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=28885">http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=28885</A>. You need a C compiler (typically gcc/g++ on Linux or Visual C/C++ on Windows) to build from source. The C compiler should the same as that used to build Python.
</P>

<P>
To build ELLIPT2D, enter the top ELLIPT2D directory and type "python setup.py build". If you have root access, then (as super user) type "python setup.py install". Otherwise just point your PYTHONPATH environment variable to the build/lib.[OS-platform-version] directory and you should be set.
</P>

No need to have a C/C++ compiler in this case when selecting ellipt2d-x.x.win32-py*.exe. 

<p>The executables were compiled using VC 7 (.NET). Those who don't have the .NET run time environment installed will need to download msvcr70.dll from <A HREF = "http://www.dll-files.com">www.dll-files.com</A>. Make sure to have the right permission set when unzipping msvcr70.zip (the WinZip program will take care of this). Then drop the msvcr70.dll file in C:\WINNT\system32 or equivalent.</p>

<p>Win98 users may in addition need to download mfc70.dll and mscoree.dll. </p>
