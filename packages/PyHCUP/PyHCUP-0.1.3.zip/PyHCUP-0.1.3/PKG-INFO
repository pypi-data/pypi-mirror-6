Description: PyHCUP is a Python library for parsing and importing data obtained from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Program (http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov).
        
        In particular, most of the data provided by HCUP is in fixed-width text (ASCII or \*.asc) files, with meta data available in separate load files. This library is built to use the SAS format load files (\*.sas).
        
        Example Usage
        ================================================
        
        Load a datafile/loadfile combination.::
        
            import pyhcup
            
            #specify where your data and loadfiles live
            datafile = 'D:\\Users\\hcup\\sid\\NY_SID_2009_CORE.asc'
            loadfile = 'D:\\Users\\hcup\\sid\\sasload\\NY_SID_2009_CORE.sas'
            
            #pull basic meta from SAS loadfile
            meta_df = pyhcup.sas.meta_from_sas(loadfile)
            
            #use meta knowledge to parse datafile into a pandas DataFrame
            df = pyhcup.sas.df_from_sas(datafile, meta_df)
        
        Deal with very large files that cannot be held in memory in two ways.
        
        1) To import a subset of rows, such as for preliminary work or troubleshooting, specify skiprows and/or readrows using sas.df_from_sas()::
        
            #optionally specify readrows and/or skiprows to handle larger files
            df = pyhcup.sas.df_from_sas(datafile, meta_df, readrows=5*10**5, skiprows=10**6)
        
        2) To iterate through chunks of rows, such as for importing into a database, first use the metadata to build lists of column names and widths. Next, use pandas built-in read_fwf to create a generator yielding manageable-sized chunks.::
        
            names = [x for x in meta_df.field]
            widths = [int(x) for x in meta_df.width]
            chunk_size = 500000
            
            import pandas as pd
        
            reader = pd.read_fwf(datafile, header=None, widths=widths, names=names, chunksize=chunk_size)
            for df in reader:
                #do your business
                #such as replacing sentinel values (below)
                #or inserting into a database with another Python library
        
        Whether you are pulling in all records or just a chunk of records, you can also replace all those pesky missing/invalid data placeholders from HCUP (this is less useful for generically parsing missing values for non-HCUP files).::
        
            #also, this bulldozes through all values in all columns with no per-column control
            replaced = pyhcup.parser.replace_df_sentinels(df)
