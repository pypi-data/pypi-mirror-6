        The basic layout for this Django app with out-of-the-box configuration of ``setup.py`` for
        easy build, submission to PyPi, etc., and Sphinx documentation tree was generated with Audrey Roy's excellent `Cookiecutter`_
        and Daniel Greenfield's `cookiecutter-djangopackage`_ template.

        History
        -------
        
        0.2.0 (2014-02-24)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * New base functionality
        
          * Added framework for managing user-specific data (user configurations,
            saved searches, etc.) and querying user-specific data in templates and views.
        
          * Added tracking of namespace information per component of a fact term
        
        * New/Modified views
        
          * Modifications to all views
        
            * Added possibility to switch between horizontal and vertical layout ...
              or have automatic adjustment of the layout depending on screen width.
        
          * Modifications to filter views
        
            * Modified date-picker in filters to enable addition of timespans without
              changing saved searches or messing up order of timespans
        
            * Added several further filter criteria in InfoObject filter
        
          * Added view with basic and still rather restricted editing capabilities for
            InfoObjects -- currently only used for editing user preferences or
            edits by the superuser
        
          * Added view to edit user configuration
        
          * Added view to edit saved searches
        
          * Added per-column ordering to list views
        
          * Added new filter/search that shows unique Facts rather than all
            InfoObjects containing a certain fact.
        
        * New/added capabilities for writing views
        
          * Added framework for ordering list views
        
          * Added per-user configuration for:
        
            * layout (horizontal vs. vertical)
            * number of rows to show in list views
            * number of rows to show in widget displaying objects in which a
              displayed object is embedded
        
        * Bug fixes / Improvements
        
          * Generation of filter views became unbearably slow when many
            (> 40,000) InfoObjects are in the system. This was, because
            of a badly built query within the dynamically built filter
            form. This has been fixed.
        
          * Further development of JSON export (still needs work to make
            the to_dict function of InfoObjects generic and configurable such as
            the from_dict function)
        
          * Fixed bug in generation of InfoObjects: when a placeholder for a given
            ID already existed, it was not reliably found.
        
        * New/Modified command-line commands
        
          * Import command now fails gracefully if import of a file
            throws an exception: it continues with import of the next file.
        
          * Added command line arguments to basic import command:
        
            * ability to add IDs of marking objects to be added to imported objects
        
            * ability to automatically move imported XML files to other folder after
              import
        
          * Added command to reset user-settings and saved searches for a given user.
        
          * Added command to re-calculate object names.
        
            This is useful to run right after an import, recalculating the
            names of 'Observable' InfoObjects created in the past few minutes.  Thus, the
            problem that those Observables that are to be named after the (single)
            object they contain do not carry a proper name (because at creation time
            of the Observable, the Object usually does not exist, yet) can be fixed.
