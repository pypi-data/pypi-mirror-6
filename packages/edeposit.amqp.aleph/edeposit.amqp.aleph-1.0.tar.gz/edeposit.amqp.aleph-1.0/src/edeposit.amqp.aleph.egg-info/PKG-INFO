Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides an AMQP middle-ware for communication with Aleph.
        Aleph is system used in libraries to store meta-data about books and
        authors.
        
        You can read `some
        documentation <http://edeposit-amqp-aleph.readthedocs.org/cs/latest/>`__,
        but that is based on acceptance test and not really actual.
        
        Actual documentation can be found in docstrings in each .py source file.
        
        Acceptance tests
        ----------------
        
        They are written using `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org/>`__
        and they are stored at src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests directory.
        
        You can run them manually (from the root of the package):
        
        ::
        
            $ pybot -W 100 --pythonpath src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests/:src src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests/
        
        Or continuously using nosier:
        
        ::
        
            $ nosier -p src -b 'export' "pybot -W 100 --pythonpath src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests/ --pythonpath src src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests/"
        
        Status of acceptance tests
        --------------------------
        
        You can see results of tests at files
