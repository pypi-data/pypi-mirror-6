This package is a very simple package to ease the software management of CellNOptR
packages and its plugins. It may be generalised to any R packages.

The only tool available allows to check out a SVN, get a specific
revision of a valid R package and create a tar ball to be distributed.


.. warning:: may be merged with rtools in the future.
