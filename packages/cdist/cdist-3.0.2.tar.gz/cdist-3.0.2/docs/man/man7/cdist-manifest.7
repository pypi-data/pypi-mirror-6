.SH "NAME"
cdist-manifest \- (Re\-)Use types
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Manifests are used to define which objects to create\&. Objects are instances of \fBtypes\fR, like in object oriented programming languages\&. An object is represented by the combination of \fBtype + slash + object name\fR: \fB\fIfile/etc/cdist\-configured\fR\fR\fB is an object of the type \fR\fB\fB\fR\fBfile\fR\fR with the name \fB\fBetc/cdist\-configured\fR\fR\&.
.sp
All available types can be found in the \fBcdist/conf/type/\fR directory, use \fBls cdist/conf/type\fR to get the list of available types\&. If you have setup the MANPATH correctly, you can use \fBman cdist\-reference\fR to access the reference with pointers to the manpages\&.
.sp
Types in manifests are used like normal command line tools\&. Let\(cqs have a look at an example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# Create object of type __package with the parameter state = absent
__package apache2 \-\-state absent

# Same with the __directory type
 __directory /tmp/cdist \-\-state present
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
These two lines create objects, which will later be used to realise the configuration on the target host\&.
.sp
Manifests are executed locally as a shell script using \fB/bin/sh \-e\fR\&. The resulting objects are stored in an internal database\&.
.sp
The same object can be redefined in multiple different manifests as long as the parameters are exactly the same\&.
.sp
In general, manifests are used to define which types are used depending on given conditions\&.
.SH "INITIAL AND TYPE MANIFESTS"
.sp
Cdist knows about two types of manifests: The initial manifest and type manifests\&. The initial manifest is used to define, which configurations to apply to which hosts\&. The type manifests are used to create objects from types\&. More about manifests in types can be found in cdist\-type(7)\&.
.SH "DEFINE STATE IN THE INITIAL MANIFEST"
.sp
The \fBinitial manifest\fR is the entry point for cdist to find out, which \fBobjects\fR to configure on the selected host\&. Cdist expects the initial manifest at \fBcdist/conf/manifest/init\fR\&.
.sp
Within this initial manifest you define, which objects should be created on which host\&. To distinguish between hosts, you can use the environment variable \fB__target_host\fR\&. Let\(cqs have a look at a simple example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
__cdistmarker

case "$__target_host" in
   localhost)
        __directory /home/services/kvm\-vm \-\-parents yes
   ;;
esac
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This manifest says: Independent of the host, always use the type \fB\fB__cdistmarker\fR\fR, which creates the file \fB/etc/cdist\-configured\fR, with the timestamp as content\&. The directory \fB\fB/home/services/kvm\-vm\fR\fR, including all parent directories, is only created on the host \fB\fBlocalhost\fR\fR\&.
.sp
As you can see, there is no magic involved, the manifest is simple shell code that utilises cdist types\&. Every available type can be executed like a normal command\&.
.SH "SPLITTING UP THE INITIAL MANIFEST"
.sp
If you want to split up your initial manifest, you can create other shell scripts in \fBcdist/conf/manifest/\fR and include them in \fBcdist/conf/manifest/init\fR\&. Cdist provides the environment variable \fB\fB__manifest\fR\fR to reference to the directory containing the initial manifest (see cdist\-reference(7))\&.
.sp
The following example would include every file with a \fB\&.sh\fR suffix:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# Include *\&.sh
for manifest in $__manifest/*\&.sh; do
    # And source scripts into our shell environment
    \&. "$manifest"
done
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "DEPENDENCIES"
.sp
If you want to describe that something requires something else, just setup the variable "require" to contain the requirements\&. Multiple requirements can be added white space separated\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# No dependency
__file /etc/cdist\-configured

# Require above object
require="__file/etc/cdist\-configured" __link /tmp/cdist\-testfile \e
   \-\-source /etc/cdist\-configured  \-\-type symbolic

# Require two objects
require="__file/etc/cdist\-configured __link/tmp/cdist\-testfile" \e
   __file /tmp/cdist\-another\-testfile
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
All objects that are created in a type manifest are automatically required from the type that is calling them\&. This is called "autorequirement" in cdist jargon\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
The initial manifest may for instance contain the following code:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# Always create this file, so other sysadmins know cdist is used\&.
__file /etc/cdist\-configured

case "$__target_host" in
   my\&.server\&.name)
      __directory /root/bin/
      __file /etc/issue\&.net \-\-source "$__manifest/issue\&.net
   ;;
esac
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The manifest of the type "nologin" may look like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
__file /etc/nologin \-\-source "$__type/files/default\&.nologin"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This example makes use of dependencies:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# Ensure that lighttpd is installed
__package lighttpd \-\-state present
# Ensure that munin makes use of lighttpd instead of the default webserver
# package as decided by the package manager
require="__package/lighttpd" __package munin \-\-state present
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "SEE ALSO"
