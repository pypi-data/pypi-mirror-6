Description: Collectfast
        ===========
        
        [![Downloads](https://pypip.in/v/Collectfast/badge.png)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Collectfast)
        
        The fast `collectstatic` for Django projects with S3 as storage backend.
        
        Running Django's `collectstatic` command can become really slow as more and more files are 
        added to a project, especially if heavy libraries such as jQuery UI are included in the source.
        This is a custom management command that compares the md5 sum of files with S3 and completely
        ignores `modified_time`. The results of the hash lookups are cached locally using your default
        Django cache. This can make deploying much faster!
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the app using pip:
        
            $ pip install Collectfast
        
        Make sure you have this in your settings file and add `'collectfast'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:
        
        ```python
        STATICFILES_STORAGE = "storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage"
        AWS_PRELOAD_METADATA = True
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            # â€¦
            'collectfast',
        )
        ```
        
        Optionally, you can set `COLLECTFAST_CACHE` in your Django settings.py file to specify a specific cache backend for collectfast to use.  By default it is set to the `default` cache.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Collectfast overrides Django's builtin `collectstatic` command so just run
        `python manage.py collectstatic` as normal. You can disable collectfast
        by using the `--ignore-etag` option.
