        Django Citations
        ================
        
        Citations is a simple Django app which lets you use a citations and 
        reference lists within your templates. 
        
        The source code is available from https://github.com/will-hart/django-citations
        under an MIT license
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "citations" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'citations',
            )
        
        2. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the polls models.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You can use the admin panel to create references for your site.  These can
        have a range of details including ISBN, URLs, titles, etc. Each reference 
        must have a unique slug.  This is how we will refer to the reference when we
        cite it within a template.
        
        To refer to a reference in your database, you first need to load the tags in
        your template::
        
            {% load citation_tags %}
        
        You can then do the following in your template where you want the reference to
        appear::
        
            {{ cite "my_reference_slug" }}
            
        You can refer to multiple references at a time by just adding new slugs separated by spaces.
        Note that quotation marks are required around the slugs, and slug names should not contain 
        spaces::
        
            {{ cite "my_first_reference_slug" "my_second_reference_slug" }}
            
        If you attempt to reference a work that is not in your reference list a TemplateSyntaxError
        will be raised showing the offending reference slug.  
        
        The references will be included in text as numbers - e.g. `[1]`, or `[1, 2]` for multiple
        references.  Reference objects will also be placed in the `reference_list` variable of the
        template's context.  
        
        A reference list can be included at the bottom of the document::
        
            {% show_references reference_list %}
