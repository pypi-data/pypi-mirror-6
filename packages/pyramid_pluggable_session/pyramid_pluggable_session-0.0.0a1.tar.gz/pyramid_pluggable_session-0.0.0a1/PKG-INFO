Description: pyramid_pluggable_session
        =========================
        
        Want to be able to change out session backends using a simple configuration
        change, want to store your session data in a new location but re-implementing
        ISession from Pyramid looks too daunting, fear not, pyramid_pluggable_session
        makes this really simple.
        
        Is this a pyramid_beaker replacement?
        =====================================
        
        Yes. Although I've already been told that unless I implement ALL existing
        beaker backends that I am not doing it right, so I am hereby doing it wrong
        ;-).
