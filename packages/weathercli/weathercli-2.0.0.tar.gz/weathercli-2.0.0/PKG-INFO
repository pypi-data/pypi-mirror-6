Description: You've spent hours, days, months, maybe **years** customizing your terminal. And yet so many things draw your attention away from it.
        
        GONE are the days of wasting non-terminal moments looking up the current weather! Now, ask your terminal:
        
            $ weather portland,me
            It's 6° and light snow
        
        Thank you, terminal--I think I *will* spend more time inside with you.
        
        BUT WAIT, THERE'S MOAR!!
        
        You can now set your location as an environment variable `WEATHER` and never have to type that query again!
        
            $ export WEATHER=portland,me && weather
            It's 6° and light snow
            $ weather
            It's 6° and light snow
        
        The query you pass in will override the environment variable, though, so you can still check how people in less-fortunate climates are faring:
        
            $ export WEATHER=portland,me && weather "los angeles,ca"
            It's 76° and sunny
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Installation couldn't be easier:
        
            $ pip install weathercli
        
        (This is, of course, after you've run `easy_install pip` and `pip install --upgrade pip`. Simple!)
