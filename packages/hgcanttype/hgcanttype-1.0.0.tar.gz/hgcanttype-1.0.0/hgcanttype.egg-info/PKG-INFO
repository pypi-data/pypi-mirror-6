Description: hg-canttype: mercurial extension for bad typists
        ================================================
        
        Corrects simple typing errors in commands using
        `Damerau-Levenshtein distance <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau–Levenshtein_distance>`_.
        
        Ever typed `hg dfif`, `hg doff` or `hg banrch`? This fixes that.
        
        
        Some examples of how it helps::
        
            $ hg dfif
            Correcting 'dfif' to 'diff'
        
            $ hg brnch
            Correcting 'brnch' to 'branch'
        
        
        Installation & Setup
        --------------------
        
        Installing hg-canttype is simple::
        
            $ pip install hg-canttype
        
        
        Setup is easy too, just add hgcanttype to your hgrc::
        
            [extensions]
            hgcanttype=
        
        You can configure the distance to consider a command "close enough" like so::
        
            [canttype]
            distance = 5
        
        
        The default is 1. Take note that setting the distance too high is a bad idea::
        
            $ hg dfif
            Correcting 'dfif' to 'help'
