Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        raptus.multilanguageurl provides multilingual URLs for content types having
        a multilingual title field provided by raptus.multilanguagefields. The IDs
        will initially be generated from the language specific titles and may afterwards
        be changed using the rename action.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        After installing the package through the quickinstaller tool the multilingual
        IDs may be generated by navigating to the view named *update_multilanguage_ids*
        as a manager user.
