Description: ================
        Secure Passwords
        ================
        
        The **SecPass** suite of programs, tools, and protocols is designed to
        allow fairly easy creation, distribution, rotation, and management of
        very secure passwords in the most secure manner possible, without
        compromising ease-of-use too much.
        
        Please note that the ``secpass`` library only provides low-level
        drivers and command-line tools. If you are interested in a more
        user-friendly interface, please try the `SecPass-GUI
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/secpass_gui>`_ package.
        
        
        .. WARNING::
        
          2013/12/27: The SecPass package is currently under active
          development, i.e. it is not ready for use. Unless you like living on
          the edge, of course. So, until further notice, SecPass is explicitly
          in "beta" (at best), functionally incomplete, but can do some things
          at times reliably. You should only use it if you make lots of
          backups and don't mind losing data. Cheers!
