Description: `datascope-tools` consists of a collection of scripts, tools, and
        ideas that we have collected over the years at
        [Datascope Analytics](http://datascopeanalytics.com) that help with
        our workflow and some very basic command-line data analysis.
        
        This is somewhat inspired by
        [bit.ly's data_hacks](https://github.com/bitly/data_hacks)
