        ===========
        
        Make some beautiful corner plots.
        
        Corner plot /ˈkôrnər plät/ (noun):
            An illustrative representation of different projections of samples in
            high dimensional spaces. It is awesome. I promise.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Just run
        
        ::
        
            pip install triangle_plot
        
        to get the most recent stable version.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The main entry point is the ``triangle.corner`` function. You'll just use it
        like this:
        
        ::
        
            import numpy as np
            import triangle
        
            ndim, nsamples = 5, 10000
            samples = np.random.randn(ndim * nsamples).reshape([nsamples, ndim])
            figure = triangle.corner(samples)
            figure.savefig("triangle.png")
        
        With some other tweaks (see `demo.py
        <https://github.com/dfm/triangle.py/blob/master/demo.py>`_) you can get
        something that looks awesome like:
