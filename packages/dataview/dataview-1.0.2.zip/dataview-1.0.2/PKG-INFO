        -----------------
        
        .. code-block::
        
            >>> from dataview import DataView
            >>> # You have some data, it can be any sequence (str, list, bytes, tuple, etc..)
            >>> source_data = list(range(5))
            >>> # DataView is just a pointer to your source_data and start/stop/step
            >>> DataView(source_data)
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
            >>> DataView(source_data, 3)
            [0, 1, 2]
            >>> DataView(source_data, 1, 5)
            [1, 2, 3, 4]
            >>> DataView(source_data, None, None, -1)
            [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
            >>> # You can use slices (completely the same way as list slices)
            >>> DataView(source_data)[::-1]
            [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
            >>> # Slice return a new DataView object, that points to the previous DataView
            >>> DataView(source_data)[::-1][2:4]
            [2, 1]
            >>> # You can change start/stop/step anytime
            >>> view = DataView(source_data, 0, 1)
            >>> view.start = 1
            >>> view.stop = 2
            >>> view
            [1]
            >>> # View always points to actual data
            >>> source_data[1] = 2
            >>> view
            [2]
            >>> # You can change a view source data
            >>> view.data = list(range(5))
            >>> view
            [1]
