PanCake -- An annotation-independent non-database approach for pangenome analysis

PanCake is a non-databse approach for identification of singletons and core regions 
in arbitrary sequence sets and independent of annotation data.
On the basis of pairwise sequence similarities (as provided by common sequence 
alignment tools) PanCake serializes pangenomes into persistent data structures 
providing further analysis and graphical representation.
Due to sequence storage of similar subregions as edit operations, storage requirement 
of PanCake's data structure is noticeably reduced in comparison to pure sequence data 
(e.g. FASTA format).
