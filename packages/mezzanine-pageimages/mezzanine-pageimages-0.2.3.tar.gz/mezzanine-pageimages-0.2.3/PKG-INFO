Description: mezzanine-pageimages
        ====================
        
        Define (background-/banner-)images per page
        
        # The Problem
        
        At least our designer likes to create websites where pages can have individual backgrounds. Or individual banners. So for example the index-page has a generic background, while all pages under _Contact_ should have another background.
        
        Mezzanine has this great feature that templates are searched by
        `page-name.html`, `<content_type>.html` and then `page.html`. so one
        would just create specific templates for the pages that get different
        background. Its a nice solution that even works. But it has drawbacks:
         - To change the background, the designer has to ask the programmer because it
           can't be changed in the admin-backend.
         - When you have multiple child-pages which should all get the background of
           the parent-page, you end up with templates for each page.
         - When the designer or writer adds another page, the programmer has to add
           another template.
        
        Mostly the problem is mixing content with design-code.
        
        # The Solution
        
        Here is how mezzanine-pageimages solves this:
         - In the admin-backend we just add a way to define images for certain roles
           and specific to certain pages. Plus a way to define default-images for the
           roles.
         - We define a template-tag `pageimage` that takes a role and the looks for
           the fitting image for the current page.
         - When there is no image for that role for the current page, it looks for an
           image on the parent page. It goes upwards until there is no parent or an
           image is found.
         - When there is still no image found, the default image for that role is
           returned, if there is one defined.
        
        # Install
        
        This package is on pypi.python.org. To simply install it just do `pip install mezzanine-pageimage`. Or define it as a requirement in your _requirements.txt_ or _setup.py_.
        
        For hacking on mezzanine-pageimages do a git-checkout and install via `pip install -e`. Or install by `pip install -e git+https://github.com/bcs-de/mezzanine-pageimages.git#egg=mezzanine-pageimages`.
        
        # Usage
        
        Add the app to your `INSTALLED_APPS`. You can define your own image-roles in the `SETTINGS` in settings.py:
        
        ```python
        PAGEIMAGE_TYPES = (
            ('BACKGROUND', 'Description text'),
        )
        ```
        
        Then use it in your templates:
        
        ```
        {% load pageimage_tags %}
        
        Lets get the url for the background image: {% pageimage 'BACKGROUND' %}
        ```
