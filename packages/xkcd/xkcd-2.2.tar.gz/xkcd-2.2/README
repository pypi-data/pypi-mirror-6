xkcd v2.2 - A Python interface to xkcd.com
By Ben Rosser
Released under MIT License (see LICENSE.txt)

This is a Python library for accessing and retrieving links to comics from the
xkcd webcomic by Randall Munroe. It is NOT endorsed or made by him, it's an
entirely independent project.

It makes use of the JSON interface to Randall's site to retrieve comic data.
One can create comic objects manually using Comic(number), or can use the helper
functions provided- getLatestComic(), getRandomComic(), and getComic()- to do
this. Once you have a Comic object, you can access data from it using various
provided methods.

Documentation:

I will eventually get around to generating some proper HTML docs for the module,
but in the mean time here's the output of "pydoc xkcd":
