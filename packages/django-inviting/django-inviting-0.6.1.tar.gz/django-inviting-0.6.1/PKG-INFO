        Usage
        =====
        
        You can configure ``django-inviting`` app's behaviour with the following
        settings:
        
        :INVITATION_INVITE_ONLY:
            Set this to True if you want registration to be only possible via
            invitations. Default value is ``False``.
        
        :INVITATION_EXPIRE_DAYS:
            How many days before an invitation is expired. Default value is ``15``.
        
        :INVITATION_INITIAL_INVITATIONS:
            How many invitations are available to new users. If
            ``INVITATION_INVITE_ONLY`` is ``False`` this setting
            has no effect. Default value is ``10``.
        
        :INVITATION_PERFORMANCE_FUNC:
            A method that takes an ``InvitationStats`` instance and returns a
            ``float`` between ``0.0`` and ``1.0``. You can supply a custom
            performance method by reference or by import path as a string.
            Default value is ``None``. If a custom performance function is not
            supplied one of the default performance functions in ``invitation.models``
            will be used according to ``INVITATION_INVITE_ONLY`` value.
        
        :INVITATION_REWARD_THRESHOLD:
            A ``float`` that determines which users are rewarded. Default value
            is ``0.75``.
