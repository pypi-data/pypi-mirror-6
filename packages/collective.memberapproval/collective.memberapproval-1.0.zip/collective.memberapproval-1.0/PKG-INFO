        process, making it possible to approve or disapprove member registrations to
        your website.
        
        
        Management views
        ----------------
        
        collective.memberapproval providess the following management views:
        
        * @@usergroup-userprefs: collective.memberapproval overrides the standard
          user management view with one that extends the standard view with a filter
          to list only Approved, only Disapproved or All users.
          
        * @@user-approval: This view will allow you to view and change the status of
          a specific user. You access it with the parameter 'userid', ie
          http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@user-approval?userid=theusername
          
        * @@user-approve: This view will approve the specified user. It does not
          provide any HTML view, but is usable for services such as providing
          a direct link to approve users from a notification email. Example:
          http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@user-approve?userid=theusername
        
        * @@user-disapprove: This view will disapprove the specified user. It does
          not provide any HTML view, but is usable for services such as providing a
          direct link to disapprove users from a notification email. Example:
          http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@user-disapprove?userid=theusername

        **************
        
        1.0 (2014-01-31)
        ----------------
        
        - Added support for Plone 4.3.
        
        
        1.0rc2 (2012-06-27)
        -------------------
        
        - Added new registered.pt and registered_notify_template.pt templates that
          includes information that the registration needs to be approved before you
          can sign in.
        
        1.0rc1 (2012-06-26)
        -------------------
        
        - There are now three states: Pending, Approved, Disapproved. You can this
          way show all pending users. You can only approve or disapprove users, you
          can not make them pending once they have been approved or disapproved.
          
        - Having an approval link in the tabs confused the users, so I removed it.
        
        - Added a "Disapprove & Delete" button at the request from users.
        
        - Changed @@user_approved to @@user_approved for consistency.
