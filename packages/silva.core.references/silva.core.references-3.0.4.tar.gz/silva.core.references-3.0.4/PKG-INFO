        Introduction
        ============
        
        ``silva.core.references`` is a core `Silva`_ extension that defines
        directed references between two Silva content: a source and
        target. With the help of a central catalog, you have the possibility
        to query the references in both direction: who is the target if I am
        the source, and who is the source if I am the target.
        
        References are tagged with different names, and can be found by
        searching on one of those names.
        
        Unless you use weak references, you can't remove an content which is a
        target of a reference, you will get an error. If you used a weak
        reference, the source will be removed.
        
        This extension provides you with a set of fields and widgets that can
        be used in forms (`zeam.form`_ and Formulator) in SMI.
