prettyplotlib
=============

Python matplotlib-enhancer library which painlessly creates beautiful
default matplotlib plots. Inspired by Edward
Tufte's work on information
design and Cynthia Brewer's
work on color perception.

I truly believe that scientific progress is impeded when improper data
visualizations are used. I spent a lot of time tweaking my figures to
make them more understandable, and realized the scientific world could
be a better place if the default parameters for plotting libraries
followed recent advances in information design research. And thus prettyplotlib was born.
