Sub-library which contains the code necessary to run an instance of the master
server.  Each master instance is intended to be able to serve:
    * the underlying REST api for PyFarm
    * backend for the admin interface
    * layer between requests and resources such as:
        * agents
        * queue management
        * jobs and tasks
        * progress information
        * general metrics
