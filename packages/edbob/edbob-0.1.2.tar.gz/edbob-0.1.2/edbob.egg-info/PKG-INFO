        =====
        
        edbob is a Pythonic software framework, released under the GNU Affero General
        Public License.
        
        It aims to be "environment-neutral" in that it can assist with development for
        console, web, or GUI applications.  Pay only for what you eat; however all of
        its functionality combined may be considered a "full stack" of sorts.
        
        For more information, please see `edbob.org <http://edbob.org/>`_ or send email
        to `Lance Edgar <mailto:lance@edbob.org>`_.

        0.1.2
        -----
        
        * Allow config file to prevent logging configuration from happening.
        
        
        0.1.1
        -----
        
        * Some random things required in production at MaMa Jean's...
        
          Specifically this is known to replace occurrences of e.g. ``edbob.User`` with
          a more standard (properly imported) reference to ``User``.
        
        
        0.1a29
        ------
        
        * Removed ``setup.cfg`` file.
        
        * Changed some logging instances from ``INFO`` to ``DEBUG``.
        
        * Updated ``repr()`` output for model classes.
        
        
        0.1a28
        ------
        
        - [bug] Secured daemon PID files.  They are no longer readable or writeable
          (whoops) by anyone other than the user who owns the process.
        
        - [feature] Added ``--progress`` argument to command system.
        
        - [general] Added initial Fabric script.
        
        
        0.1a27
        ------
        
        - [feature] Overhauled file monitors.  Added the "process existing" (defaults
          to true) and "stop on error" (defaults to false) features to both Linux and
          Win32 file monitors.  Both features may be overridden in config.  The Linux
          file monitor was rewritten as an ``edbob.daemon.Daemon`` class.
        
        0.1a26
        ------
        
        - [feature] Added ``StrippingFieldRenderer``.
        
        - [general] Some style tweaks.
        
        - [bug] Fixed ``graft()`` function when called with module reference.
        
        0.1a25
        ------
        
        - [feature] Added "sqlerror" tween which, in combination with ``pyramid_tm``,
          can allow Pyramid apps to gracefully handle database server restarts.  Any
          transaction which fails due to a disconnection from the server may be
          attempted more than once.  The assumption is that the second attempt will
          succeed, since the underlying connection pool will have been invalidated upon
          the first failure.
        
        - [feature] Added ``PHONE_TYPE`` enumeration.
        
        - [general] Added some ``__unicode__()`` methods to database models.
        
        - [bug] Fixed CSS in the ``progress.mako`` template.
        
        - [feature] Improved the ``load_spec()`` function so that it raises an
          ``InvalidSpec`` exception if the spec doesn't contain exactly one colon.
        
        0.1a24
        ------
        
        - [bug] Fixed bug where creating a new ``Role`` with the UI would use default
          permissions of the Guest role.  Now the default permissions are empty.
        
        - [bug] Fixed ``User.roles`` UI so that the Guest role is never shown.
        
        0.1a23
        ------
        
        - [feature] Added ``capture_output()`` function to ``win32`` module.  This is a
          convenience function which works around an issue when attempting to capture
          output from a command when the calling application is a Windows GUI app which
          was launched via the Windows console (DOS terminal).
        
        - [feature] Updated ``User`` and ``Role`` management views for Pyramid apps.
        
        0.1a22
        ------
        
        - [feature] Added a view which allows a user to change his/her password from
          within Pyramid web apps.
        
        - [general] Tweaked styles for form validation errors.
        
        - [general] Added convenience subclass of ``formencode.Schema``.
        
        - [general] Split CSS styles into ``base.css`` and ``layout.css``, since really
          they serve different purposes.
        
        - [feature] Added ``overwriting_move()`` convenience function.
        
        0.1a21
        ------
        
        - [feature] Added the ability to specify a Mako template for use when
          generating error emails.  Templates may be referenced in the config file
          using either a resource path or an absolute file path.  If no template is
          specified, the plain text fallback will be used.  The ``content_type`` of the
          email is also configurable (defaults to ``'text/html'`` if a Mako template is
          used; ``'text/plain'`` otherwise).
        
        0.1a20
        ------
        
        - [feature] Added ability to configure path to the PID file used by file
          monitor daemons running on Linux.  This was necessary to allow multiple
          daemons to run on the same machine.
        
        0.1a19
        ------
        
        - [general] Added ``active_extensions`` stubs to alembic migration script
          template.
        
        - [general] Updated pyramid user views and templates.  These were sorely out of
          date.
        
        0.1a18
        ------
        
        - [feature] Added ``engine_from_config()`` function to ``edbob.sqlalchemy``
          module.  This was done to provide awareness of the ``poolclass`` parameter to
          engine configuration.
        
        0.1a17
        ------
        
        - [feature] Added ``display()`` method to ``AutocompleteView``.  This allows
          overriding the display text for autocomplete results, in the event that
          ``str(result)`` isn't good enough.
        
        - [bug] Fixed ``request.has_perm()`` function so that it can check for
          permissions on the "guest" role, in the event a user is not logged in.
        
        0.1a16
        ------
        
        - Add ``alembic/*.py`` to ``MANIFEST.in``.
        
        - Various progress tweaks.
        
        - Add ``OrderedDict`` import to ``util`` module.
        
        0.1a15

        - Fix alembic ``env.py`` template.
        
        0.1a14
        ------
        
        - Slight overhaul of init() system; added ``edbob.init_modules()`` function.
        
        - Added ``read_service()`` method to ``AppConfigParser`` class, for use with
          Windows services.
        
        - Added generic ``Service`` class to ``edbob.win32`` module.  (File monitor now
          inherits from it.)
        
        - Tweaked ``edbob.db`` initialization somewhat.  (``Base.metadata`` no longer
          binds to ``edbob.db.engine``.)
        
        - Fixed guest role bug in ``edbob.db.auth.has_permission()`` function.
        
        - Added "automagical" enumeration support for database extensions.
        
        - Added ``EMAIL_PREFERENCE`` enum to ``contact`` database extension.
        
        - Tweaked ``edbob.pyramid.includeme()``.
        
        - Tweaked ``people`` Pyramid views.
        
        - Added ``edbob.daemon`` module.
        
        0.1a13
        ------
        
        - ``edbob.pyramid.Session`` uses ``sessionmaker()`` instead of
          ``edbob.db.Session``.
        
        - ``edbob.pyramid.includeme()`` now configures ``pyramid_beaker`` directly.
        
        - ``edbob.pyramid.includeme()`` now configures auth/auth policies directly.
        
        - Pyramid progress indicator added.
        
        - ``edbob.pyramid.Session`` added to global template render context.
        
        - ``request.get_referrer()`` method added (removed ``edbob.pyramid.util``
          module).
        
        - ``request.get_setting()`` and ``request.save_setting()`` methods added.
        
        - ``Grid.column_header()`` now supports ``title`` attribute.
        
        - ``Grid.editable`` support added.
        
        - Template / style tweaks.
        
        - ``text`` argument to ``disable_button()`` JS function is now optional.
        
        - Forbidden view flash message no longer duplicated when multiple redirects
          occur.
        
        - ``CrudView`` class improved to support various workflow needs
          (e.g. post-delete procesing).
        
        - Extra renderer keyword args support added to ``GridView`` class.
        
        - ``SearchableAlchemyGridView`` class improved to support various workflow
          needs (e.g. obtaining an unsorted query).
        
        - Fixed file monitor on Linux.
        
        - Added ``pyramid_exclog`` dependency for Pyramid apps.
