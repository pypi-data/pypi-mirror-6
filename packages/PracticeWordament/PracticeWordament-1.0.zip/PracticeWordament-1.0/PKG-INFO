Description: Practice Wordament
        =================
        
        A mimic of the popular word game Wordament published by Microsoft Studios
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        To run this application, you need to have **PyQt4** installed on your machine. 
        
        Find the source packages for various platforms [here](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download).
        
        For Ubuntu, you can also install it by: `sudo apt-get install python-qt4` 
        
        Usage
        -----
        - Go to the main directory and install the game by running `python setup.py install`
        - Once installed, start the python interpreter from the terminal and run the application:
            - `from practicewordament import *`
            - `start()`
        - Make as many words as you can in the allotted time of 60 seconds
        
        If at all you are interested in the details of the implementation, you can have a look at my [blog post](http://gravetii.github.io/articles/practice-wordament/).
