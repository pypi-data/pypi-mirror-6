 Announcing PyTables 3.1.1
===========================

We are happy to announce PyTables 3.1.1.

This is a bug-fix release that addresses a critical bug that make PyTables
unusable on some platforms.


What's new
==========

- Fixed a critical bug that caused an exception at import time.
  The error was triggered when a bug in long-double detection is detected
  in the HDF5 library (see :issue:`275`) and numpy_ does not expose
  `float96` or `float128`. Closes :issue:`344`.
- The internal Blosc_ library has been updated to version 1.3.5.
  This fixes a false buffer overrun condition that made c-blosc to fail,
  even if the problem was not real.

As always, a large amount of bugs have been addressed and squashed as well.

What it is?
===========

PyTables is a library for managing hierarchical datasets and
designed to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data with
support for full 64-bit file addressing.  PyTables runs on top of
the HDF5 library and NumPy package for achieving maximum throughput and
convenient use.  PyTables includes OPSI, a new indexing technology,
allowing to perform data lookups in tables exceeding 10 gigarows
(10**10 rows) in less than a tenth of a second.

Thanks to many users who provided feature improvements, patches, bug
reports, support and suggestions.  See the ``THANKS`` file in the
distribution package for a (incomplete) list of contributors.  Most
specially, a lot of kudos go to the HDF5 and NumPy makers.
Without them, PyTables simply would not exist.
