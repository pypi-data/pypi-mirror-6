"""\
Call the "best" Python 2 interpreter on the system,
to be precise: the highest version below Python 3.

This tool is tested on Windows only, since it is needed there most dearly:
When installing Python there, 'python.exe' is usually not in the PATH!
"Shebang" magical comments are not used there; instead, filename extensions are
ASSOCiated with file types, and file types with programs.

py2.py doesn't query the registry; it looks for directories where Python would
be typically installed (see thebops.likeix.PythonVDirs).

Linux systems look different: 'python' (typically /usr/bin/python) is a
symbolical link to pythonX.Y.  Thus, a search on Linux could check the location
of those link targets for python*.* entries; this is not yet implemented.

To put it short:  On Windows systems (or any system which provides the
Windows-style environment variables SystemDrive etc.), this script should call
always the same Python interpreter, regardless of which one it was called
itself;  otherwise it will probably simply use the first (or only) 'python' in
the PATH.
