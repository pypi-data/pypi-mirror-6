Description: rpdb - remote debugger based on pdb
        ==================================
        
        rpbm is a wrapper around pdb that re-routes stdin and stdout to a socket
        handler. By default it opens the debugger on port 4444::
        
            import rpdb; rpdb.set_trace()
        
        But you can change that by simply instantiating Rpdb manually::
        
            import rpdb
            debugger = rpdb.Rpdb(12345)
            debugger.set_trace()
        
        It is known to work on Jython 2.5 to 2.7, Python 2.5 to 3.1. It was written
        originally for Jython since this is pretty much the only way to debug it when
        running it on Tomcat.
        
        Upon reaching `set_trace()`, your script will "hang" and the only way to get it
        to continue is to access rpdb using telnet, netcat, etc..::
        
            nc 127.0.0.1 4444
        
        Installation on CPython (standard Python)
        -----------------------------------------
        
            pip install rpdb
        
        Installation in a Tomcat webapp
        -------------------------------
        
        Just copy the rpdb directory (the one with the __init__.py file) in your
        WEB-INF/lib/Lib folder along with the standard Jython library (required).
        
        Known bugs
        ----------
          - The socket is not always closed properly so you will need to ^C in netcat
            and ^\ in telnet to exit after a continue.
          - There is a bug in Jython 2.5/pdb that causes rpdb to stop on ghost
            breakpoints after you continue ('c'), this is fixed in 2.7b1.
