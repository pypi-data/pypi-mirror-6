Description: ==========
        SilvaViews
        ==========
        
        ``SilvaViews`` is a component that is used by `Silva`_ to attach old
        style views (implemented by directory views templates and python
        scripts) to objects.
        
        It is no longer used in `Silva`_ 3.

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.16.2 (2012-12-17)
        -------------------
        
        * This is just a re-release of the previous version.
        
        0.16.1 (2010-02-07)
        -------------------
        
        * If a directory is registered in the views system but no longer
          exist, just ignore it, don't error.
        
        0.16 (2010-10-05)
        -----------------
        
        * When looking for paths for a view for a content type, try to fallback
          to the default *Five compatible* path if the content type as nothing registred.
        
        0.15 (2010-03-31)
        -----------------
        
        * Compatibility for ``silva.core.conf.utils.makeZMIFilter`` (formerly
          ``Products.Silva.utils.makeContainerFilter``).
        
        0.14 (2008-09-30)
        -----------------
        
        * Reformat documentation to release as an egg.
        
        0.13
        ----
        
        * Modified class registration for new Silva 2.1
          product registration, using a zmi-add-list filter.  SilvaViews
          will still function if Silva is not present
        
        0.11
        ----
        
        * The improvement in 0.10 created problems inside Silva
          itself. Reverted this to older situation.
        
        0.10
        ----
        
        * Changed way SilvaViews find the right view pages. There is now less
          chance an object in content space will have an id clash with a
          view.
        
        0.9
        ---
        
        * Initial public release.
