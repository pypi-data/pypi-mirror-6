Welcome to django-pgfields
==========================

This is django-pgfields, a pluggable Django application that adds support
for several specialized PostgreSQL fields within the Django ORM.

django-pgfields will work with Django applications using the PostgreSQL
backend, and adds support for:

* Arrays
* Composte Types
* JSON
* UUIDs

Dependencies & Limitations
--------------------------

django-pgfields comes with two dependencies:

* Python 3.3+ (Python 2 is *not* currently supported.)
* Django 1.5+
* Psycopg2 2.5+

.. warning::

    Currently, django-pgfields is not particularly interoperable with the
    PostGIS backend from ``django.contrib.gis``. Any individual model can
    either use our Manager subclass or the GIS Manager subclass, but not both.

    This limitation will (hopefully) be addressed soon.

Quick Start
-----------

In order to use django-pgfields in a project:

* Installation
    * ``pip install django-pgfields``
    * Add ``django_pg`` to your ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``.
* Usage
    * Essentially: Import our models module instead of the stock Django module.
      So, replace ``from django.db import models`` with
      ``from django_pg import models``.
    * The new field classes provided by ``django_pg`` are now available
      on the models module. Use, for instance, ``models.UUIDField`` and
      ``models.ArrayField`` just as you would use ``models.CharField``.
