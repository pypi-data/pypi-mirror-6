    # - in order to get python to load the local variables correctly, it takes
    #   all its local variables as arguments
    # - the code preceding the instruction pointer is replaced by NOP (and, if
    #   possible, skipped with a JUMP_FORWARD)
    # - if we need to fake a return value (i.e. from another operation we
    #   faked), we append the object to return at the end of the code object's
    #   co_consts, and inject a LOAD_CONST instruction into the code.
    # this code is then executed as a function call to a new function with
    # patched __code__. we have to jump through a couple of hoops to get this
    # function right; see get_function_in_context above.
