      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        ------------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from paAPI import POA, PBA
        
            # connect to POA
            pem = POA('mn.hostname.com')

        .. code:: python
        
            from paAPI import POA, PBA
            
            # connect to POA

        ---
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from paAPI import POA, PBA
            
            # connect to POA 
            pem = POA('mn.hostname.com', ssl=True)
            
        Custom Port
        -----------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from paAPI import POA, PBA
            
            # connect to POA 
            pem = POA('mn.hostname.com', port=8888)
        
        =========================================
        Parallels Operations Automation (POA) API
        =========================================
        
        All but three of the POA API calls start with 'pem', for this reason it is recommended you name your POA connection object 'pem' so you can call functions exactly how they are documented in the POA API as has been done in the examples in this Readme.
        
        The full POA Public API Reference can be found here:
        
        http://download.pa.parallels.com/poa/5.5/doc/index.htm?fileName=56781.htm
        
        Basic API Call
        --------------
        
        This example will show the pem.getAccountInfo_ method being called.
        
        .. _pem.getAccountInfo: http://download.pa.parallels.com/poa/5.5/doc/7915.htm
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from paAPI import POA
        
            pem = POA('mn.hostname.com', port=8888)
            
            d = {
                'account_id' : 1002242
            }
            
            print pem.getAccountInfo(**d)
            
            # {'status': 0, 'result': {'fax': {'phone_num': '', 'ext_num': '', 'area_code': '', 'country_code': ''}, 'account_type': 'C', 'phone': {'phone_num': '00000000', 'ext_num': '', 'area_code': '04', 'country_code': '61'}, 'brand': {'brand_id': 191, 'domain_name': 'brandingdomain.com', 'name': 'brandname'}, 'email': 'noreply@example.com', 'person': {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Smith', 'middle_name': '', 'company_name': 'Test Account', 'title': ''}, 'address': {'city': 'Canberra', 'country': 'au', 'street_name': '1 Test Street', 'zipcode': '2621', 'state': 'ACT', 'house_num': '', 'address2': ''}, 'parent_account_id': 1002241}}
        
        API Call with 'array of struct'
        -------------------------------
        
        The POA API often calls for values and settings to be sent as an 'array of struct'. This example shows how to send these values using the paAPI client.
        
        This example is based on the pem.activateSubscription_ method with resources types called 'DiskSpace' and 'Bandwidth' and a domain name.
        
        .. _pem.activateSubscription: http://download.pa.parallels.com/poa/5.5/doc/39160.htm
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from paAPI import POA
        
            pem = POA('mn.hostname.com', port=8888)
            
            # define the resource limits:
            DiskSpace = {
                "resource_id" : 1002486,
                "resource_limit" : 1024
            }
            Bandwidth = {
                "resource_id" : 1002487,
                "resource_limit" : -1
            }
            
            # define the paramaters:
            DomainName = {
                "var_name"  : "DomainID",
                "var_value" : "example.com.au"
            }
            
            # setup the call:
            d = {
                "account_id"           : 1002242,
                "subscription_name"    : "Hosting (example.com.au)",
                "subscription_id"      : 1006754,
                "service_template_id"  : 204,
                "resource_limits"      : [DiskSpace, Bandwidth],
                "paramaters"           : [DomainName],
            }
            
            # execute the call:
            result = pem.activateSubscription(**d)
        
        
        Transactions
        ------------
        
        There are three POA API calls that do not start with pem in the official documentation. When using paAPI you can use these API calls as documented but you will still need to preface them with your POA connection object (the examples on this page use 'pem' as the connection object name).
            
        .. code:: python
        
            from paAPI import POA
        
            pem = POA('mn.hostname.com', port=8888)
            
            # being transaction
            pem.txn.Begin()
            
            # commit transaction
            pem.txn.Commit()
            
            # rollback transaction
            pem.txn.Rollback()
           
           
        Error Handling
        --------------
        
        The POA API has quite good responces when an error occurs during an API call. The below example shows the responce format for POA API errors:
        
        
        .. code:: python
        
            {
                'status'         : -1, 
                'extype_id'      : 21, 
                'module_id'      : 'OpenAPI', 
                'error_message'  : 'Invalid set of arguments. There should be specified EITHER external_info OR person, address, phone, [fax], [locale], email.', 
                'properties'     : { 
                                       'reason': 'Invalid set of arguments. There should be specified EITHER external_info OR person, address, phone, [fax], [locale], email.'
                                   }
            }
        
           
        ==================================================
        Parallels Business Automation (PBA) API
        ==================================================
        
        The PBA API is quite different from the POA API, and not quite as user friendly. The paAPI client makes using the PBA a little easier by standardizing the returned responces, providing status codes, and decoding any error messages.
        
        The major difference between the POA and PBA api is how values are sent and received. In PBA params are sent and responces are received as a list in a specific order to know what each value represents.
        
        The full PBA Public API Reference can be found here:
        
        http://download.pa.parallels.com/pba/5.5/doc/pdf/SDK_API/pba_5.5_public_api_reference.pdf
        
        Basic API Call
        --------------
        
        This example will show the **AccountDetailsGet_API** method being called.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from paAPI import PBA
            
            api = PBA('pba.hostname.com')
            
            print api.Execute('AccountDetailsGet_API', params=['1002242'])
            
            # {'status': 0, 'result': [1002242, 1002241, 'Test Account  5543', '1 Test Street', '', 'Canberra', '', '2621', 'au', '', 'John', 'D', 'Smith', 'noreply@example.com', '61', '04', '000000000', '', '', '', '', '', 1351787114, 2, 0]}
            
        Alternate Server
        ----------------
        
        Most PBA API method calls use the "BM" server. Some methods use alternate servers such as "PEMGATE" or "DOMAINGATE". This example shows how to specify an alternate server:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from paAPI import PBA
            
            api = PBA('pba.hostname.com')
            
            api.Execute('DomainExpirationDateGet_API', params=params, server='DOMAINGATE')
            
        Error Handling
        --------------
        
        paAPI takes the way POA returns errors natively and applies it to the PBA API. The status on each responce will either be **0** for a succesfull call, or **-1** if PBA returned an error.
        
        This is an example of what is returned in the case of an error:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            {
                'status'        : -1, 
                'error_message' : 'Table Account does not contain row with ID 99999999.', 
                'server'        : 'BM', 
                'host'          : 'pba.hostname.com', 
                'params'        : ['99999999'],
