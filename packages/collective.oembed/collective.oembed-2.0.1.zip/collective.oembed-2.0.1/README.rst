oembed provider
===============

Your site will become an oembed provider using @@oembed view as an endpoint::

    URL Scheme: http://mysite.com/*
    API endpoint: http://mysite.com/@@oembed
    Supports discovery via <link> tags

This addon use archetypes getPrimaryField to get the most representative field
of your content type and then build information on how to embed this content

To change this behavior you can override the view for specific context::

    <browser:page
        name="oembed"
        for="my.specific.context.IMYContent"
        class="my.specific.provider.OEmbedProvider"
        permission="zope2.View"
        layer="my.specific.layer.Layer"
        />
    
    
    from collective.oembed.provider.
    class OEmbedProvider(OEmbedProvider):
        def add_context_info(self, ob, site):
            self.embed['type'] = 'rich'
            ...


oembed client
=============

This addon provide an integration of jquery.oembed_ plugin. Because there are
many fork you have to choose the one you will use. The official plugin has been
integrated to plone throw the addon collective.js.oembed_

The oembed client is integrated using a viewlet that is not activated by
default. You have to activate it throw the controlpanel. It is configured that
way::

    <script type="text/javascript">
      jqueryOmebedSettings = {...} //extracted from the controlpanel
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
            $(document).ready(function() {
                $(".oembed").oembed(null,jqueryOmebedSettings);
            });
    </script>

consumer
========

A consumer is availabe throw a utility::

    >>> url = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it1hMtZKle8"
    >>> consumer = component.getUtility(collective.oembed.interfaces.IConsumer)
    >>> consumer.get_data(url, maxwidth=300, maxheight=None, format='json')
    {...}

There is also a @@collective.oembed.consumer view, which can take params throw
attributes::

    >>> consumer_view = component.queryMultiAdapter((self.context,self.request),
    ...                                 name=u'collective.oembed.consumer')
    >>> consumer_view._url = url
    >>> consumer_view.embed_auto()
    <div class="oembed-wrapper oembed-video">...</div>

OEmbed link view
================

This addon register an oembed view to the Link content type. It displays
content provided from the remote url and do not set maxwidth & maxheight. It
should be achieved by integrators.

The link view stores 3 different lists of components:

* oembed
* api2embed
* url2embed

oembed
------

Contains registered views of type oembed_view , able to get the html
embed template from the targetted provider's oembed api (see below for a
list of currently supported providers).

api2embed
---------

If you have an API key for the targeted website, you should be able to
use it through those views.
Once this feature is implemented, you should be able to choose whether
you want to activate it or not.

url2embed
---------

Contains registered views of type url2embed_view, which get the embed
template directly from the target's url.
Used as a fallback for websites who do not support the oEmbed format.

NOTE::

    While the returned data will be sufficient to embed the target
    widget in your view, you won't be able to access the metadata which
    could have been associated with it in a straight oEmbed format.

All three lists are checked in the same order as they're presented here,
and the first valid component found is used to get the embed code.
If no match at all is found, then nothing will be displayed.

Check endpoint.csv to see which of those views are currently supported for
each service.

Embed.ly
========

This addon can use embed.ly_ service. You can set the embed.ly api key in the
control panel or install and configure collective.embedly, this addon will
use the configuration provided by this one.

Proxy OEmbed Endpoint
=====================

This addon provide consumer and provider. Both can be used at the same time
in the proxy oembed endpoint. It means you can ask your site how to display
an URL what ever it comes from the site itself or from outside.


Other Plone addons
==================

* collective.portlet.oembed_
* collective.js.oembed_
* collective.embedly_

Addon design (targeted to 2.0)
==============================

The internal code has been completly redone on 2.0

Goals:

* code easier to understand
* less components
* performance optimization

The provided integration use only json throw ajax request.

We have one main view which achieve the job:
@@proxy-oembed-provider

This one use a ram cache with a cache-key based on:
* url + max-width + max-height
* 1 hour (in case distant html has changed)

There is a structure key/value with hostname as keys
and low level consumer name as values which are instanciated when needed (lazy
loading) so it use less memory.

TODO
----

Make the global structure configurable to:

* blacklist some hostname throw portal_registry
* add new key/value hostname/consumername throw portal_registry
* override existing value throw portal_registry
