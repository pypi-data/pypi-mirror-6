Installing Silva News Network

  This package requires Silva 2.0, SilvaExternalSources 1.5 and 
  z3locales 0.1 (all of which can be found on http://www.infrae.com).

  Unpack the SilvaNews package into the Products directory of your
  Zope installation and restart Zope. Go to the Silva root and click
  on the 'service_extensions' object. Scroll to the SilvaNews entry
  and click 'Install'. The product should now be installed correctly.

  Note: for SilvaNews to work correctly for news items to be published
  or expired in the future, a script needs to be registered to cron or
  some other scheduler so it calls the 'status_update' URL at a
  regular interval. 'status_update' will search Silva for versions of
  which the publication status should be updated, and updates that
  status.

  This means that objects which don't get called directly (only using
  the catalog, like News does) get their publication status' updated,
  which would usually happen by calling them through the web
  (viewing).

  This URL can be constructed from the URL to your Silva root with
  the name '/status_update' appended.

  A helper script to call a URL called 'call_url.py' can be found in
  the 'utils' directory of the Silva core package.
