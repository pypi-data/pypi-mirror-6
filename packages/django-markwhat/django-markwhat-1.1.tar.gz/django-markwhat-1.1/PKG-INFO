        ------
        
        A collection of template filters that implement common markup languages.
        
        provides template filters that implement the following markup
        languages:
        
        * ``textile`` -- implements `Textile`_ -- requires `PyTextile`_
        * ``markdown`` -- implements `Markdown`_ -- requires `Python-markdown`_
        * ``restructuredtext`` -- implements `reST (reStructured Text)`_
          -- requires `doc-utils`_
        
        In each case, the filter expects formatted markup as a string and
        returns a string representing the marked-up text. For example, the
        ``textile`` filter converts text that is marked-up in Textile format
        to HTML.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        ``django-markwhat`` is available on pypi:
        
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-markwhat
        
        So easily install it by ``pip``:
        ::
            
            pip install django-markwhat
        
        Or by ``easy_install``
        ::
            
            $ easy_install django-markwhat
        
        Another way is by cloning ``django-markwhat``'s `git repo <https://github.com/Alir3z4/django-markwhat>`_ :::
            
            git clone git://github.com/Alir3z4/django-markwhat.git
        
        Then install it by running:
        ::
            
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Configuration
        ******************
        
        To activate these filters, add ``'django_markwhat'`` to your
        ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting. Once you've done that, use
        ``{% load markup %}`` in a template, and you'll have access to these filters.
        
        .. warning::
        
            The output of markup filters is marked "safe" and will not be escaped when
            rendered in a template. Always be careful to sanitize your inputs and make
            sure you are not leaving yourself vulnerable to cross-site scripting or
            other types of attacks.

        reStructured Text
        -----------------
        
        When using the ``restructuredtext`` markup filter you can define a
        `RESTRUCTUREDTEXT_FILTER_SETTINGS` in your django settings to
        override the default writer settings. See the `restructuredtext writer
        settings`_ for details on what these settings are.
        
        .. warning::
        
           reStructured Text has features that allow raw HTML to be included, and that
           allow arbitrary files to be included. These can lead to XSS vulnerabilities
           and leaking of private information. It is your responsibility to check the
           features of this library and configure appropriately to avoid this. See the
           `Deploying Docutils Securely
           <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/howto/security.html>`_ documentation.

        Markdown
        --------
        
        The Python Markdown library supports options named "safe_mode" and
        "enable_attributes". Both relate to the security of the output. To enable both
        options in tandem, the markdown filter supports the "safe" argument.
        ::
            
            { markdown_content_var|markdown:"safe" }}
        
        .. warning::
        
            Versions of the Python-Markdown library prior to 2.1 do not support the
            optional disabling of attributes and by default
