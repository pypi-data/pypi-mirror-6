description:
  Transform MRML Files to New EMSegmenter Standard

Inputs::

        [Mandatory]
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

        [Optional]
        args: (a string)
                Additional parameters to the command
        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a value of type 'str' and
                 with values which are a value of type 'str', nipype default value:
                 {})
                Environment variables
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)
                Print an error message instead of throwing an exception in case the
                interface fails to run
        inputMRMLFileName: (an existing file name)
                Active MRML scene that contains EMSegment algorithm parameters in
                the format before 3.6.3 - please include absolute file name in path.
        outputMRMLFileName: (a boolean or a file name)
                Write out the MRML scene after transformation to format 3.6.3 has
                been made. - has to be in the same directory as the input MRML file
                due to Slicer Core bug - please include absolute file name in path
        templateFlag: (a boolean)
                Set to true if the transformed mrml file should be used as template
                file
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

Outputs::

        outputMRMLFileName: (an existing file name)
                Write out the MRML scene after transformation to format 3.6.3 has
                been made. - has to be in the same directory as the input MRML file
