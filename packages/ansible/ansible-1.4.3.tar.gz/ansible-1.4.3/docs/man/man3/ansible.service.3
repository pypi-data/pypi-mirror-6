.SH OPTIONS
   
.IP arguments
Additional arguments provided on the command line   
.IP enabled
Whether the service should start on boot. At least one of state and enabled are required.
.IR Choices :
yes,no.   
.IP name
Name of the service.(required)   
.IP pattern
If the service does not respond to the status command, name a substring to look for as would be found in the output of the \fIps\fR command as a stand-in for a status result.  If the string is found, the service will be assumed to be running.(Added in Ansible version 0.7.)
   
.IP runlevel
For OpenRC init scripts (ex: Gentoo) only.  The runlevel that this service belongs to. (default: default)   
.IP sleep
If the service is being \fCrestarted\fR then sleep this many seconds between the stop and start command. This helps to workaround badly behaving init scripts that exit immediately after signaling a process to stop.(Added in Ansible version 1.3.)
   
.IP state
\fCstarted\fR/\fCstopped\fR are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary.  \fCrestarted\fR will always bounce the service.  \fCreloaded\fR will always reload. At least one of state and enabled are required.
.IR Choices :
started,stopped,restarted,reloaded..\"
