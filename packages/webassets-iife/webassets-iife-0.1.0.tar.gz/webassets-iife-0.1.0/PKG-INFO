        ``webassets-iife`` is a webassets_ filter to wrap a JavaScript bundle in an
        IIFE to prevent global leaks and improve minification.
        
        .. _webassets: https://webassets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
        
        Install
        -------
        
        .. code-block::
        
            pip install webassets-iife
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        For example with Flask:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            from flask.ext.assets import Environment, Bundle
            from webassets_iife import IIFE
        
            # ...
        
            assets = Environment(app)
        
            js = Bundle('myscript1.js',
                        'myscript2.js',
                        filters=(IIFE, 'closure_js'), output='all.min.js')
            assets.register('js_all', js)
        
        This will concat ``myscript1.js`` and ``myscript2.js`` into one JS chunk, wrap
        it in an IIFE and minify it.
        
        IIFE?
        -----
        
        An *IIFE* is an Immediately-Invoked Function Expression. It’s an anonymous
        function that’s declared and invoked immediately after that. It’s used in
        JavaScript to create a closed environment which can’t be accessed from the
        outside.
        
        .. code-block::
        
            // a and b can be accessed by external code
            var a = 3,
                b = 1;
            // ... some code ...
        
            // a and b can't be accessed by external code
            (function() {
                var a = 3,
                    b = 1;
                // ... some code ...
            })();
        
        Wrapping code in an IIFE helps the minifier see the dead code, because it
        *knows* that these local variables can’t be accessed from the outside and thus
        can remove them or mangled their name.
