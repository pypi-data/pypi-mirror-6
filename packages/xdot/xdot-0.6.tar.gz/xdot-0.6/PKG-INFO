Description: 
                xdot.py is an interactive viewer for graphs written in Graphviz's dot
                language.
        
                It uses internally the graphviz's xdot output format as an intermediate
                format, and PyGTK and Cairo for rendering.
        
                xdot.py can be used either as a standalone application from command
                line, or as a library embedded in your python application.
