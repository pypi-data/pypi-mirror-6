Description: **PO Projects** is a first attempt to build a PO file management factory like, 
        somehow like Transifex, but more simplest.
        
        Principle is to have a frontend board to create new PO project from a POT file to import, 
        then add it and manage language translation and finally export all these PO to include it 
        in your app (django or another).
        
        **This is in beta staging, models are not stable yet, there is no documentation and frontend is far from usable, you've be warned!**
        
        Actually we have
        ================
        
        * View to create new project from a PO/POT file;
        * View to create new project translation and edit them;
        * View to export project translations as PO files;
        * View to export an archive (zip/tarball) of all translations as PO files from a project;
        * Manage fuzzy mode for translations;
        
        For beta staging this should implement
        ======================================
        
        * Form to import a catalog (PO) to update a catalog;
        * Better global ergonomy;
        * Better model admin;
        * Permission restriction;
        * User authoring to know who has done what;
        * External API access to get PO files or global project archive from external tools 
          (like Optimus or a Django app from an external site) ?
        * Restrict external API access
