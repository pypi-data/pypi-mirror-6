This directory contains the example to test the analysis of a 2-time point data set. The file **PKN-ToyMMB_T2.sif** is a model used in several articles and for many tests in CellNOpt. The accompanying data **MD-ToyMMB_T2.csv** was generated by Camille Terfve for the CellNOptR tutorial.

In addition to PKN-ToyMMB.sif, this model contains a inhibitor from cJun to Jnk.
