Description: ========
        coinshot
        ========
        
        A simple Python module for `Pushover.net`_
        
        Example
        =======
        See `example.py`_ for full example::
        
            from coinshot import Coinshot, CoinshotException
        
            coinshot_object = Coinshot(application_key[, user_key])
        
            coinshot_object.push(message[, title, user_key, device, url, url_title, priority, timestamp])
        
        shoot.py

        Usage
        -----
        ::
        
            Usage: shoot.py [options] message
        
            Options:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -a APP_KEY, --application-key=APP_KEY
                                    Application key provided by pushover.net
              -u USER_KEY, --user-key=USER_KEY
                                    User key provided by pushover.net
              -t TITLE, --title=TITLE
                                    Notification Title
        
        Notes
        =====
        * ``user_key`` is required either during object initialization or when calling
          push. If a ``user_key`` is provided for both, the one passed to push takes
          precedent.
        * ``url_title`` can be passed without ``url``, but will be ignored
        
        To Do
        =====
        See `todo.md`_
        
        What's the deal with the name?
        ==============================
        The name coinshot is derived from a class of characters from Brandon
        Sanderson's Mistborn book series. Coinshot Allomancers "burn" steel to Push
        nearby metals.
