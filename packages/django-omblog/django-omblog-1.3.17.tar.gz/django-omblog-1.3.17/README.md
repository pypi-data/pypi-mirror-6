Omblog is a django based blog system designed to have a smooth, minimal writing experience so it's a joy to use and be heavily cached so it can take a battering. 

It is currently being worked on after a long break, however please be
aware that at this current time there is no default frontend skin for
displaying your posts, there is only the UI for creating / editing.

[The documentation will help you get started](http://django-omblog.readthedocs.org/)

If you're looking for a blog that you can style to death that can take a
battering, then give omblog a try.

## Current Features

* Minimal UI for writing posts
* Drag and drop image uploading with automatic thumbnailing
* Syntax highlighting
* Keyboard shortcut to save posts
* Tab key inserts 4 spaces and doesn't bounce out of the writingarea.
* If you have Django's cache backend configured, it can take a battering.
