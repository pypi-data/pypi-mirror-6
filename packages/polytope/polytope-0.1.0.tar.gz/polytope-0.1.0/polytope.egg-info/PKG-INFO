Description: Polytope
        ========
        
        This is the source repository for ``polytope``, a toolbox for geometric
        operations on polytopes in any dimension.  Documentation and examples are
        available in the directories ``doc/`` and ``examples/``.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It suffices to::
        
          python setup.py install
        
        To avoid checking for optional dependencies, add the option "nocheck"::
        
          python setup.py install nocheck
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        Required: ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``cvxopt``, ``networkx``.
        
        Optional: ``matplotlib``.

        Acknowledgment
        --------------
        Polytope was part of the `Temporal Logic Planning Toolbox (TuLiP)
        <http://tulip-control.org>`_ before growing to become an independent package.
        It originates from changesets 7bb73a9f725572db454a0a5e4957da84bc778f65 and
        3178c570ee1ef06eb8ace033f205f51743ac54c6 of `TuLiP
