'''
The dining `philosophers`_ problem is an example problem often used in
concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronisation issues and
techniques for resolving them.

The problem
===================

Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with each a bowl of spaghetti.
A fork ``f`` is placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers ``P``::


         P     P
         O  f  O
        f       f
     P O         O P
         f     f
            O
            P

Each philosopher ``P`` must alternately think and eat from his bowl ``O``.
Eating is not limited by the amount of spaghetti left: assume an infinite
supply.

However, a philosopher can only eat while holding both the fork ``f`` to
the left and the fork to the right.
Each philosopher can pick up an adjacent fork, when available, and put it down,
when holding it. These are separate actions: forks must be picked up and put
down one by one.

This implementation will just work. No starvation or dead-lock.

There are two parameters:

* Average eating period, the higher the more time is spend eating.
* Average waiting period, the higher the more frequent philosophers
  get a chance to eat.

To run the example, type::

    pulsar manage.py
