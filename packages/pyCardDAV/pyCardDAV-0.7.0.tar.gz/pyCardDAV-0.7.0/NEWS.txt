 The man pages should now be included in the release tarball.

25.11.2013: pyCardDAV v0.6 released

 This is mostly a bug fix release (thanks to Jamie McClelland for fixing
 two bugs), but also introduces keyring support (thanks to Steven Allen).
 Have a look at the README for further information on keyring support.

02.09.2013: pyCardDAV v.0.5.1 released

  pyCardDAV v0.5.1 is released. This is a bugfix release, if everything works
  fine for you, there is no need to upgrade. Database deletion should not be
  necessary.

15.06.2013: pyCardDAV v.0.5.0 released

 **New** This release brings support for multiple CardDAV accounts. See the
 usage instructions, the supplied example config and/or pc_query --help. Also
 support for more CardDAV servers is included. If you are upgrading, you need to
 delete the local database, otherwise pyCardDAV will refuse to work.

 **Attention** In accordance with RFC 6352 all VCards that are imported
 or changed by pyCadDAV will automatically get a random UID (if they
 haven't one already), as some CardDAV servers, e.g. Owncloud require
 these.

28.03.2013: pyCardDAV v0.4.1 released

  pyCardDAV v0.4.1 is released. This is a bugfix release, if everything works
  fine for you, there is no need to upgrade. Database deletion should not be
  necessary.

15.11.2012: pyCardDAV v0.4 released

  pyCardDAV v0.4 is released. This is a mayor rewrite (again), so some previously
  fixed bugs might be back in. If your upgrading, you should delete your database
  file first.

  On the plus side, there are some new features in pyCardDAV:

    experimental write support in the backend
    import & export vCards
    import addresses directly from mutt
    speed increase in (initial) sync due to switching from pycurl to requests
    detects removed cards on server and delete them locally
    can delete cards locally and then on server

  Also the license has changed to MIT/Expat, see the COPYING file for details
  (but a beer is still appreciated).

  PyCurl is not required anymore, pyCardDAV relies on requests now (which needs
  to be installed).

  Special thanks to David Soulayrol who made a lot of this happen.

  Attention: please make sure you have a backup when you enable write support, see
  Usage for more details.

27.01.2012: pyCardDAV v0.3.3_ released:
  **New** sabredav/owncloud support, thanks Davide Gerhard.

  Fixes a bug where properties with no type parameters were not printed.

  This release also fixes a small database bug.

  The config file has a new entry (*davserver*) which you can set to
  either davical or sabredav (depending on your CardDAV server).

  Future:
  The source code has been cleaned up quite a bit (nearly every line of code
  has been touched) and some features have been added. Write support is nearly
  finished in the backend (but will probably not be included in the next
  release yet), but the frontend is still really buggy and a pain to use. If
  you want to have a look, check the repository out at github and check the
  branch *write_support* (but it might me broken).

06.01.2012: pyCardDAV v0.3.2_ released:
  this is a minor bugfix update, db deleting should not be necessary. If
  everything is working fine at the moment, there is no need to upgrade.

06.01.2012: pyCardDAV v0.3.1_ released:
  this bugfix release fixes some bugs on Debian and a formatting bug (thanks to
  Antoine Sirinelli) and one more unicode bug (thanks to Thomas Klausner). Also,
  some more meaningful error messages were added.

  **Attention** if you are upgrading:
  you should delete the old database again and resync using pycardsyncer

08.12.2011: pyCardDAV v0.3_ released:
  this fixes an unicode bug and has a lot of internal changes

  **Attention** pc-query has been renamed to pc_query,
  make sure to delete the old database, also the config file
  format has somewhat changed
