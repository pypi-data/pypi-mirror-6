-------------

-  Catched an exception when the Logging File is deleted while **sIBL_GUI** write into it.
-  Refinements in **sIBL_GUI** UI.
-  I wanted **sIBL_GUI** next stable release to be a 1.5, but since we are introducing the sIBL V2 File Format, I'm jumping the release numbers closer to 2.0.

1.4.3 - Alpha
-------------

-  GPS Map Zooming code has been tweaked, it should be smoother now.
-  Added OpenGL support to the GPS Map. There are some new related options in the preferences.
-  Tweaks in sIBL_Framework Dynamic Lights Handling to correct some problems with Maya Mel Script.

-------------

-  Refinements in **sIBL_GUI** UI.

1.4.1 - Alpha
-------------

-  An Online Version Checker is now checking for **sIBL_GUI** Last Releases.
-  The Manual Browser has been changed to a more powerfull Widget (QWebView).

1.4.0 - Alpha
-------------

-  sIBL_IO Refactored to a more generic Class (sIBL_Parser).
-  Corrected one of the most nastier Bug I encountered since I'm working on **sIBL_GUI**. QSetting Class seems to affect Qt Dynamic Libraries (I'm using the Jpeg one) in a way that was making Qjpeg not working when reading settings.
-  FTP Code is now Threaded. Interface should be smooth while Downloading.
-  **sIBL_GUI** is now able to load multiple Help files (It will be possible to provide Help Files for the Templates now).
-  sIBL_Templates Class has been changed to a more generic and flexible Class (sIBL_Recursive_Walker).
-  Refinements in **sIBL_GUI** UI to include the new Help features.

1.3.0 - Alpha
-------------

-  Refactored **sIBL_GUI** Settings Code using the QSettings Class.

1.2.5 - Alpha
-------------

-  Refactored **sIBL_GUI** Logging / Verbose: Now **sIBL_GUI** and sIBL_Framework use Python Standard Logging. Both are using a Log file: ****sIBL_GUI**_LogFile.log** for **sIBL_GUI** and **sIBL_Framework_LogFile.log** for sIBL_Framework. Those files are deleted then created each time the softwares start. One side effect is that if you launch two instances of **sIBL_GUI**, they will both output Log to ****sIBL_GUI**_LogFile.log** file, while it will not prevent **sIBL_GUI** from working, both Logging will be mixed.
-  Refactored **sIBL_GUI** Functions Call Trace: A Decorator is now used to trace whenever a function is called.
-  Added a brand new GPS Map under the Collection Browser. You can now see a Marker Cloud of sIBL Locations.

0.9.6 - Alpha
-------------

-  Bug introduced with Linux Code that prevented remote execution with Maya on Windows.
-  Corrected a dangerous behavior introduced with Eclipse NSIS Plugin: It adds this line to the setup script: **RmDir /r /REBOOTOK $INSTDIR**. That means that if you installed by mistake at the root of **Program Files/** and not in **Program Files/**sIBL_GUI****, everything in **Program Files/** will be deleted. **sIBL_GUI** - 0.9.6 For Windows and 12 October Nightly Releases are concerned!
