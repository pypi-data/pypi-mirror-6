HieraPy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivannpaz/HieraPy.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ivannpaz/HieraPy)
=======

Shy attempt at porting Puppet's [Hiera](https://github.com/puppetlabs/hiera) to Python as a coding excercise.

Shamelessly forked from [multiconfig](https://github.com/basementcat/multiconfig).

Main motivation: To be able to read certain config data from Puppet's Hiera into a Fabric deploy script.

Warning:
--------

Do not use. Just don't... this is an over simplified, over dumbed down implementation of the Hiera's way to parse and merge configuration files that might kill your dog, cat, parrot if used freely. Don't held me liable for any of such things later. You were warned...
