        Example:
            
            >>> import bitalino
            >>> device = bitalino.BITalino()
            >>> 
            >>> macAddress = "00:13:01:04:04:15"
            >>> SamplingRate = 1000
            >>> device.open(macAddress, SamplingRate) # Set MAC address and sampling rate
            >>> 
            >>> th = device.battery(20) # Set battery threshold
            >>> 
            >>> BITversion = device.version() # Get BITalino firmware version
            >>> print "version: ", BITversion
            >>> 
            >>> device.start([0,3]) # Start Acquisition in Analog Channels 0 and 3
            >>> 
            >>> dataAcquired = device.read(1000) # Read 1000 samples
            >>> 
            >>> device.trigger([0,0,1,0]) # Turn BITalino led on
            >>> 
            >>> device.stop() # Stop acquisition
            >>> device.close()
            >>> 
            >>> SeqN = dataAcquired[0,:]
            >>> D0 = dataAcquired[1,:]
            >>> D1 = dataAcquired[2,:]
            >>> D2 = dataAcquired[3,:]
            >>> D3 = dataAcquired[4,:]
            >>> A0 = dataAcquired[5,:]
            >>> A3 = dataAcquired[6,:]
            >>> print SeqN
