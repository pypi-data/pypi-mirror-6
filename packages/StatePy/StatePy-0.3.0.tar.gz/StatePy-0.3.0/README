What is StatePy anyways?
------------------------

StatePy is an event driven hierarchical finite state machine library that 
lets you easily design, build, and analyze state machines.  It represents 
individuals states as classes, and by default uses static transition tables.  
The tables are simple python dicts maping events, which can be any hashable
type, to the next state. Member functions of the state classes are called upon
entering, upon exiting, and on every transition.  To learn more check out the
documentation.

Tests
-----

StatePy comes with a relatively complete, ~95% line coverage, set of unit tests 
which can be run with the simple command "python setup.py test".  If you have 
installed StatePy already you can use the function "statepy.test.runTests()" to
run the tests at any time you desire.  If you submit a feature/patch, you should
include a tests for it as well.
