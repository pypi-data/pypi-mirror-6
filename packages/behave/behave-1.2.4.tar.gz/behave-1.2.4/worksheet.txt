issue 197: Safe Hooks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTIONS:
* Should hook errors cause a step/scenario/feature to fail?
* Should hook set model_element.status := failed ???

POINTS:
* hook errors threshold
* hook can set context.failed flag (note: runner.aborted is not accessible)
* HookProfile: Determine if hook errors should counted to model_element or not?

---------------------
issue #143:
    Use parse >= 1.6.2, this fixes the observed problem.
    setup_capture must occur after load_hooks() to allow the user to setup the logging subsystem.
    Default logging level for logcapture can be set in behave configuration file.

    TODO:
      * INSPECT: setup_capture
      * INSPECT: behave.ini config possibilities related to logging config
