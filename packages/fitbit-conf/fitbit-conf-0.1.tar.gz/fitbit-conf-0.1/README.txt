Contains different useful tools and scripts for fitbit weightsite project.
Currently, it has two main scripts: fbch and dbupdate

ch is used to change multiple file at the same time.

dbup is used to add db updates.

Installation:
Use python 3 or later. Open command line in this directory and run python setup.py install. After successful installation,
open command line and run:
$ch
$dbup

Scripts ask for input and provide different hints and help. If you are familiar with fitbit infrastructure, the
instructions should be easy to follow.

Note: In theory, it should be possible to run these scripts on Windows and Mac, but I haven't tested it there.
