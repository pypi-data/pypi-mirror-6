"""Implements the |Queue| interface on top of `celery`_, a distributed task
queue system. When a message is enqueued, a delivery task is queued up in
celery. Celery workers will then pick up the task and attempt delivery, retrying
and bouncing in the same manner as |Queue|.

A :class:`celery.Celery` object must be given to :class:`CeleryQueue`, and a
task will be registered to attempt delivery of |Envelope| objects. It may be
desirable to configure celery workers to `use gevent`_, since ``slimta`` |Relay|
objects are expected to support it.
