#################################

`hospital` is a Python framework to write health checks, smoke tests or
diagnoses around applications or services.


********
Abstract
********

Health checks are kind of tests, applied to running applications and services:

* write healtchecks just as you would write tests, using assertions;
* collect and run healthchecks with test runners;
* use healthchecks to validate deployments;
* plug healthchecks in supervision and monitoring tools;
* in case of incidents, use healthchecks to diagnose problems.

`hospital` is not full-featured yet. Some important features are in the
`roadmap <https://github.com/python-hospital/hospital/issues/milestones>`_.
See also `vision
<http://hospital.readthedocs.org/en/latest/about/vision.html>`_.

Of course, any ideas, feedback and help are welcome :)
