Templates as a service.

``diecutter`` exposes an API where you manage templates as resources.
The most common operation is to **POST data to templates in order to retrieve
generated files**.

Files and directories are supported. Directories are rendered as archives.

.. note::

   Diecutter is under active development: some (killer) features have not been
   implemented yet, or they are not mature.
   Check `milestones <https://github.com/diecutter/diecutter/issues/milestones>`_
   and `vision <https://diecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/about/vision.html>`_
   for details.

   That said, features documented below actually work, so **give it a try!**


*******
Example
*******

GET raw content of a template:

.. code-block:: text

   $ curl -X GET http://diecutter.io/api/greetings.txt
   {{ greetings|default('Hello') }} {{ name }}!

POST data to the template and retrieve generated content:

.. code-block:: text

   $ curl -X POST -d name=world http://diecutter.io/api/greetings.txt
   Hello world!
