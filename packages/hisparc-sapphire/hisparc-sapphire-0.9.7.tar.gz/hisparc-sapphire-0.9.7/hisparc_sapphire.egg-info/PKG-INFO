Description: SAPPHiRE â€” A Framework for HiSPARC
        ===================================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        SAPPHiRE is a Simulation and Analysis Program Package for `HiSPARC
        <http://www.hisparc.nl/>`_ Research and Education.  It was created in the
        process of completing the PhD research of David Fokkema.  The history of
        this repository contains the complete simulation, analysis and plot
        generation code that formed the basis for David's thesis.
        
        This repository is created with a sole purpose in mind: to enable HiSPARC
        students, teachers and researchers to easily gain access to the data and
        perform common simulation and analysis tasks.  Historically, starting work
        on the data, or extending an existing analysis code, has involved
        elaborate installation instructions, heavy customizations to the software,
        countless hours going over opaque parts of code and a general feeling of
        anguish and despair.  SAPPHiRE's ultimate goal: no more of that.
        
        David has tried very hard to write clean code.  However, as is the nature
        of finishing a PhD, severe time constraints prevented him to actually
        write well-documented, clean code.  He feels, however, that the presently
        available code is a good start.  By releasing it now, it can be used,
        accessed, and cleaned up.
        
        In fact, it is probably being cleaned up at this very moment!
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using pip simply open a Terminal and do::
        
            $ pip install hisparc-sapphire
        
        This should install sapphire with all requirements. More extensive
        installation instructions are available in the documentation in the
        ``doc/`` directory.  You can compile them using Sphinx, or you can
        follow this link: http://docs.hisparc.nl/sapphire/.
        
        To check if it worked start Python and load the package:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import sapphire
        
        You're done!
