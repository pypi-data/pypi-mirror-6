        =========
        
        A crazy simple framework for creating compliant nagios plugins
        
        While the nagios monotoring framework really doesn't require mich more
        than the monitoring script return a 0/non-0 status code, to fully
        benefit from all of nagio's feautrues requires careful attention to
        output formatting and error codes.  If you have a bevy of custom
        parameters you'd like to monitor, creating a fully featured nagios
        plugin for each can be a little tedious.  This module solves that
        problem.
