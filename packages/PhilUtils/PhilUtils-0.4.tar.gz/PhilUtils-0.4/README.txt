This library contains a bunch of small miscellaneous functions,
I've built over time but didn't seem to fit in their own package.

For the foreseeable future, this library will undergo too many
changes for me to suggest that anyone use this library and I plan
on regularly shuffle things out of this library when I feel that
they would be better organized in their own package.

Use at your own risk.
