Description: This package provides a useful set of data generators that can be used in a
        wide variety of applications, like testing and sample data generation.
        
        Those generators are extensions to the ones provided in ``z3c.sampledata``.
        
        See ``src/z3c/datagenerator/README.txt`` for usage documentation.

        2.1.1 (2014-04-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug: FileDataGenerator used the full filename to generate the random seed.
          That is definitely going to break consistency/tests on someone else's system.
        
        
        2.1.0 (2013-03-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Switched code base to use ``random2``, so that Python 2 and 3 have the same
          output. No need for running different test files now.
        
        - Simplified and unified test setup.
        
        
        2.0.1 (2013-02-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated manifest to include buildout and tox configuration files.
        
        - Updated Trove classifiers.
        
        - Renamed text files from *.txt to *.rst,s o Github renders them nicely.
        
        
        2.0.0 (2013-02-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Feature: Support for Python 3.
        
        - Bug: Make sure that all files are closed properly.
        
        - Bug: When generating a username, make sure it does not include any special
          characters passed through by the first or lastname, for example "O'Dorothy".
        
        1.0.0 (2013-02-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Feature: Added tests for all data generators.
        
        - Feature: Added an ID data generator that can generate all sorts of IDs that
          could occur in systems.
        
        - Feature: To properly support Windows, ``consistent_hash()`` returns an
          integer.
        
        - Bug: The IPv4 generator ignored the seed making the generator "unstable".
        
        0.0.3 (2008-12-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Refined the seed generation further: zlib.crc32() in 32 bit Python can
          generate negative hashes, while 64 bit Python does not.  Enforced
          positive hashes.
        
        - Began a test suite.
        
        
        0.0.2 (2008-12-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Use the crc32 function to hash random seeds so that the
          same random sequences are generated on both 32 bit and 64 bit
          builds of Python.
        
        
        0.0.1 (2008-02-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial Release
