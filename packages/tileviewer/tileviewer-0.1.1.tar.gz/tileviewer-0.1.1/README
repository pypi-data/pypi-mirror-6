Quick (and dirty) tile viewer

python -m tileviewer <tiles.json>

open browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000

In addition to json files, data can be read from a mongodb

python -m tileviewer mongo:<host>:<database>:<collection>

and the serving host (default: 0.0.0.0) and port (default: 5000) can be set:

python -m tileviewer <tiles.json> <host> <port>

See tileviewer/db/dbbuilder.py for an example script to build a 
tilestore database.

See jobs for example scripts to run sever renderers on a cluster. Be sure to 
set the TILESERVER_DIR environment variable so that all renderers can 
locate other renderers.
