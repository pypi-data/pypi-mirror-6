Demo
------

there are two demo: one for the two main widgets (SqlMask and SqlTable)
and one for the layout module.

Each demo should be started from the respective directory and does not
require to be installed:

   cd demo/sql/
   python demo.py


I hope you'll appreciate it. I'd be happy to have some feedback.
