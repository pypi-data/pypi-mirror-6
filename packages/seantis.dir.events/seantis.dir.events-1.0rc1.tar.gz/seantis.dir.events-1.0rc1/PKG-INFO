        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        seantis.dir.events relies on Plone 4.3+ with dexterity and seantis.dir.base.
        
        python-magic is used to identify the type of uploaded files which requires the
        'libmagic' library.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        1. Use Plone 4.3 or newer
        
        ::
        
            extends =
                http://dist.plone.org/release/4.3/versions.cfg
        
        2. Add the module to your instance eggs
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                seantis.dir.events
        
        
        3. Ensure that the i18n files are compiled by adding
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            environment-vars = 
                ...
                zope_i18n_compile_mo_files true
        
        
        4. Install dexterity and seantis.dir.events using portal_quickinstaller
