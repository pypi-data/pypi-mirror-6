The Basics
==========

circuits.web is not a **full stack** web framework, rather
it is more closely aligned with `CherryPy <http://www.cherrypy.org>`_
and offers enough functionality to make quickly developing web applications
easy and as flexible as possible. circuits.web does not provide features such
as:

* builtin Templating
* builtin Database or ORM tools
* **etc**

The functionality that circutis.web *does* provide ensures that circuits.web
is fully HTTP/1.1 and WSGI/1.0 compliant and offers all the essential tools
you need to build your web application or website.
