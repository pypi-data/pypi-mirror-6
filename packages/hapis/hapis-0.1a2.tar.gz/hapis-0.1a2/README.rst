Overview
========

hapis is a collection of packages that help with creating plugins for Pyramid
web framework.

Each subpackage aims to make work on a certain aspect of an application more
convenient, some also serve as mediators between plugins and Pyramid.

The hapis package itself does not provide lots of useful functionality but
includes helper functions that could be used by subpackages. At the time of this
writing, these helper functions only include those for parsing complex settings
values.
