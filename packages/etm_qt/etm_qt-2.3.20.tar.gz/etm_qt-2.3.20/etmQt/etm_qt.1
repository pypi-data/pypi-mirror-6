.SH DESCRIPTION
With no arguments, etm will use settings from the
configuration file ~/.etm/etm.cfg and open the GUI.
.PP
If the first argument is the \fIpath\fP to a directory
which contains a file named etm.cfg, then settings
from that file will be used instead.
.PP
If the first argument, other than the optional \fIpath\fP,
is either "a", "c", "m", "n", "s", "?" or "l" (lower case
L), then the remaining arguments will be executed by
etm without opening the GUI.
.PP
Editing requires that edit_cmd is specified in etm.cfg. If hg_commit
is also specified then changes will automatically be committed.
