Description: This module can list, configure and execute CPL-based recipes from Python.
        The input, calibration and output data can be specified as FITS files
        or as astropy.io.fits objects in memory.
        
        The Common Pipeline Library (CPL) comprises a set of ISO-C libraries that
        provide a comprehensive, efficient and robust software toolkit. It forms a
        basis for the creation of automated astronomical data-reduction tasks. One of
        the features provided by the CPL is the ability to create data-reduction
        algorithms that run as plugins (dynamic libraries). These are called "recipes"
        and are one of the main aspects of the CPL data-reduction development
        environment. More information about the CPL can be found here:
        
          http://www.eso.org/sci/software/cpl/
        
        The interface may be used to run ESO pipeline recipes linked to CPL 
        versions 4.0 to 6.3.1.
        
        Build instructions
        ------------------
        
        python-cpl requires:
        
           - Python 2.6 or later
           - astropy or pyfits
        
        python-cpl uses the standard Python distutils system to build and install
        itself.  From the command line run::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        to install python-cpl.
