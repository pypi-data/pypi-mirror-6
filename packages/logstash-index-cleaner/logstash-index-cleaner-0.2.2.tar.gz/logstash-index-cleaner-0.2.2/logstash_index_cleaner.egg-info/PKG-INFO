        Project history
        ---------------
        
        This is a fork of https://github.com/crashdump/logstash-elasticsearch-scripts.
        
        Since ElasticSearch 0.90 all fields are compressed, and some benchmarks show that
        nothing improves optimizing those already compressed indices. That's why this fork
        does not include the original `logstash_index_optimize.py`
