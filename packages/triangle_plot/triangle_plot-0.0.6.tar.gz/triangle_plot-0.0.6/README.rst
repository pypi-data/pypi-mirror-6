===========

Make some beautiful corner plots.

Corner plot /ˈkôrnər plät/ (noun):
    An illustrative representation of different projections of samples in
    high dimensional spaces. It is awesome. I promise.

Installation
------------

Just run

::

    pip install triangle_plot

to get the most recent stable version.


Usage
-----

The main entry point is the ``triangle.corner`` function. You'll just use it
like this:

::

    import numpy as np
    import triangle

    ndim, nsamples = 5, 10000
    samples = np.random.randn(ndim * nsamples).reshape([nsamples, ndim])
    figure = triangle.corner(samples)
    figure.savefig("triangle.png")

With some other tweaks (see `demo.py
<https://github.com/dfm/triangle.py/blob/master/demo.py>`_) you can get
something that looks awesome like:
