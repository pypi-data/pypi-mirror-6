        We to be able to decline tracking cookies for Google Analytics; This is done by overriding the default analytics viewlet and check for cookiecuttr.
        
        You can also wrap your own javascript code:
        
            if (jQuery.cookie('cc_cookie_accept') == "cc_cookie_accept") {
            ...
            }
        
        
        for diazo I guess you need to add a rule for the the CookieCuttr div somewhere high up your rules
        
        <append css:theme="body" css:content="body.cc-cookies">
