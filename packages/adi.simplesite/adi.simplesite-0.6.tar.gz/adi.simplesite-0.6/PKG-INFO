Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a Plone-4 add-on that aims to help especially smaller sites to get started quicker and easier.
        
        The goal is to give the possibility to configure most common website-usecases via the webinterface for mortals. No programming needed.
        
        It does this mainly by replacing viewlets with portlets.
        
        Most functionalities are pulled in by small splitted plone-add-ons, named below, so you can roll your own combinations, installing them individually, in case you don't need parts of the whole package.
        
        
        
        The pulled subpackages are:
        
        
        - adi.init
        Deletes Plone's default contents
        
        - adi.simplestructure
        Hides viewlets and adds some samaple portlets instead in top and footer via ContentWellPortlets.
        
        - adi.samplecontent
        Adds some samplecontent and sampleportlets in left- and right column.
        
        - adi.slickstyle
        Adds a decent CSS to the portal, let's you override col, bg-col and link-col globally.
        
        - adi.dropdownmenue
        Adds a main drodwonmenu on top, showing first-level-folders, replaces Plone's globalnav.
