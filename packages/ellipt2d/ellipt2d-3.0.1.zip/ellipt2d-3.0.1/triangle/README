Installation.
=============

1) edit Makefile to adjust your platform and compiler settings. 

2) type

gmake

This will build the triangmodule.so file and move it to the appropriate directory
`uname -m`-`uname -s`. 

Notes:

The Makefile assumes the Python include files to be located in /usr/include/python1.5.
This can be overridded using

gmake PYTHONINC=-I/dir_where_headers/include/python1.5

Other switches can be changed likewise.
