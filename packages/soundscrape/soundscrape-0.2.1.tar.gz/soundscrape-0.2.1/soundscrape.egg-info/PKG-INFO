        ==============
        
        **SoundScrape** makes it super easy to download artists from SoundCloud. It even automatically creates ID3 tags as well, which is handy.
        
        Usage
        ---------
        
        First, install it:
        
        ```bash
        pip install soundscrape
        ```
        
        Then, just call soundscrape and the name of the artist you want to scrape:
        
        ```bash
        soundscrape rabbit-i-am
        ```
        
        And you're done! Hooray! Files are stored as mp3s in the format **Artist name - Track title.mp3**.
        
        Issues
        -------
        
        There's probably a lot more that can be done to improve this. Please file issues if you find them!
