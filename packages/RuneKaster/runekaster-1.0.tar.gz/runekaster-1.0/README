Requirements:

This program was tested on Ubuntu 11.10, but should run on any Linux machine that has python3.x installed.

Running RuneKaster:

Download and extract runekaster-1.0.tar.gz. To run the program, navigate to the folder containing the unzipped files, and type <python3 runekaster.py> into your terminal.

General Information:

This program randomly prints out a three-rune answer to a question posed by the user. The runes and their translations are from the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem as translated by Dikins in 1915.

Please note that this program does not give a user the opportunity to ask more than one question. If you wish to ask more than one question, please rerun the program.

Additionally, the program does not automatically save the reading results. This has to be done manually by printing out your session or by highlighting and copying the desired text to your favorite text editor.
