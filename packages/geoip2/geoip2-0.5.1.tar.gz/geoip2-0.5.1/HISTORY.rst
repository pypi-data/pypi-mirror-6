++++++++++++++++++

* IMPORTANT: `geoip.webservices` was renamed `geoip.webservice` as it

  `ipaddr` module on Python 2.x.
* We now support more languages. The new languages are de, es, fr, and pt-BR.
* The REST API now returns a record with data about your account. There is
  a new geoip.records.MaxMind class for this data.
