Description: Eliot: Logging as Storytelling
        ==============================
        
        Eliot provides a structured logging system for Python that generates as a forest
        of nested actions. Action start and eventually finish, successfully or not. Log
        messages thus tell a story: what happened, and what caused it.
        
        Features:
        
        * Structured, typed messages.
        * Action tree, with messages automatically figuring out their action context.
        * Excellent support for unit testing your logging code.
        * Twisted support.
        * JSON output, usable by Logstash/Elasticsearch.
