  <dc:title>Privacy, Part Two: Unwanted Gaze</dc:title>
  <dc:content>
This is an example content:
A growing number of lawyers and scholars, including Rosen, say they now
believe that fundamental changes in Net architecture are necessary to
protect constitutional values and restore the notion of the "inviolate
personality" to the private lives of Americans. These would include
copyright management systems to protect the right to read anonymously,
permitting individuals to pay with untraceable digital cash; prohibiting
the collection and disclosure of identifying information without the
reader's knowledge, or using digital certificates to create psudonymous
downloading.

To Rosen, author of Gaze, cyberspace is posing a greater menace to
privacy by the day. He details the l998 forced resignation of Harvard
Divinity School dean Ronald F. Thiemann, who downloaded pornography onto
his university-owned home computer. A Harvard technician installing a
computer with more memory at the dean's residence was transferring files
from the old computer to the new one and noticed thousands of
pornographic pictures. Although none of the pictures appeared to involve
minors, the technician told his supervisor. University administrators
asked the dean to step down.

Harvard justified its decision by claiming that Divinity School rules
prohibited personal use of university computers in any way that clashed
with its educational mission. But the dean was using his computer at
home, not work. And no student or colleague suggested he had improperly
behaved in any way as head of the Divinity School. His work was never
questioned. It's ludicrous to suggest that the school would have fired
him if he'd been downloading sports scores or bidding for furniture on
eBay. But although he'd committed no crime and performed well in his
job, he was forced out in disgrace, while his intimate communications
were discussed in public.


Should free citizens in a democratic society have to spend money for
"nyms" to preserve the privacy they ought to be -- and once were --
accorded in law? How many millions of computer users will even know of
this new technology, or have the money to use it?  Rosen's implication
is that even if software caused the problem, then software will clean
up.

His assurances seem a bit "gee-whiz." But to ignore them cynically on
that basis, or to trust them completely, ignores the history of
technology. What people can create, others can and will undo. Technology
that can be used will be used. In an otherwise powerful book, he also
glosses over powerful incentives for eliminating privacy in cyberspace.
First, the megacorporations dominating media, business and government
will continue to aggressively explore ways of tracking potential
customers as Net use grows. Secondly, law enforcement agencies like the
FBI have been fighting for decades for the right to deploy tracking
programs like "Carnivore" (see part one) and are hardly likely to back
off.
