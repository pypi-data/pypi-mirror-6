Description: JIP Pipeline system
        ===================
        The JIP pipeline system is a python library and a set of command
        line utilities that allows you to create batch-process based computational
        pipeline that can be submitted and managed on a compute cluster or on 
        your local machine.
        
        Installation
        ============
        The `JIP documentation <http://pyjip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ contains 
        more detailed instructions on installation and, more importantly, configuration
        of the system and your compute infrastructure. Here is the very quick guide::
        
            $> pip install pyjip
        
            or 
        
            $> python setup.py install
        
        If you want to install from *pypi* or the git repository. Afterwards, you have
        to create configuration file ``$HOME/.jip/jip.json`` and add the following 
        content::
        
            {
                "cluster": "<class_name>"
            }
        
        Replace ``<class_name>`` with the name of the class that implements support
        for your compute cluster. JIP ships with the following implementations:
        
            * ``jip.cluster.SGE`` for *Sun Grid Engine*
        
            * ``jip.cluster.Slurm`` for *Slurm*
        
            * ``jip.cluster.PBS`` for *PBS* and *Torque*
        
            * ``jip.cluster.LSF`` for *Platform LSF* and *Open Lava*
        
            * ``jip.grids.JIP`` for JIPs' internal scheduler. If you use this, make 
              sure to start the JIP server on the same machine using the ``jip server``
              command. Please note also that you have to install *pyzmq* if you want
              to run the JIP server.

        Changelog
        =========
        0.4:
            * Create a pipe command to write quick pipeline directly from the command line [`Issue 22 <https://github.com/thasso/pyjip/issues/22>`_]
            * Inconsistency between job().bash() and bash() usage in pipeline [`Issue 20 <https://github.com/thasso/pyjip/issues/20>`_]
            * Add links to job and pipeline iteration to delete functions in jip.db and jip.jobs [`Issue 19 <https://github.com/thasso/pyjip/issues/19>`_]
            * Enable parsing of memory assignments in profiles and add support for G M and K suffixes [`Issue 18 <https://github.com/thasso/pyjip/issues/18>`_]
            * "jip logs" called without argument returns an error instead of "usage" [`Issue 16 <https://github.com/thasso/pyjip/issues/16>`_]
            * Tool cleanup fails if the output points to a directory [`Issue 10 <https://github.com/thasso/pyjip/issues/10>`_]
            * Option parsing fails when multiple list options are specified and one is optional and not set [`Issue 8 <https://github.com/thasso/pyjip/issues/8>`_]
            * jip restart jobs fails as the job detects itself and refuses to submit again [`Issue 7 <https://github.com/thasso/pyjip/issues/7>`_]
            * jip jobs with selected output duplicates columns [`Issue 5 <https://github.com/thasso/pyjip/issues/5>`_]
        
        0.3 :
            * Added auto-naming support for anonymous jobs that are assigned to variables.
              The variable name is used as default job name
            * Lots of changes to the internals
        
        0.2 :
            * Added explicit UTF-8 encoding for the dependency tree
        
        0.1 : Initial release
