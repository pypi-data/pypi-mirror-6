Identification of FCC decortations
----------------------------------

Steps:
* Get binary input structures.
* Reduce them to a single composition lattice.
* Find the primitive cell.
* Is it FCC?

Deviation from Vagard's Law
---------------------------

Steps:
* For each pair of metals
* Get relaxed volume of all stable compounds
* Plot deviation vs element vs element

Addendum:
* Look for cases where some are above and some are below
* What about including the "nearly stable"
