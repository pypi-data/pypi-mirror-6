Features
========

* Frontend: Dynamic DNS updates via dyndns2 protocol (like supported
  by many DSL/cable routers and client software).
* Backends:

  - Uses DYNAMIC DNS UPDATE protocol (RFC 2136) to update compatible
    nameservers like BIND, PowerDNS and others (the nameserver itself is
    NOT included).
  - Optionally uses dyndns2 protocol to update other services - we can
    send updates to configurable 3rd party services when we receive an
    update from the router / update client.

* Prominently shows visitor's IPs (v4 and v6) on main view,
  shows reverse DNS lookup results (on host overview view).
* Multiple Hosts per user (using separate secrets for security)
* Add own domains / nameservers (public or only for yourself)
* Login with local or remote accounts (google, github, bitbucket, ...
  accounts - everything supported by python-social-auth package)
* Manual IP updates via web interface
* Shows time since last update via api, whether it used SSL or not
* Shows v4 and v6 IP addresses (from master nameserver records)
* Shows client / server fault counters, available and abuse flags
* Supports IP v4 and v6, SSL.
* Easy and simple web interface, it tries to actively help to configure
  routers / update clients / nameservers.
* Made with security and privacy in mind
* No nagging, no spamming, no ads - trying not to annoy users
* Free and Open Source Software, made with Python and Django
