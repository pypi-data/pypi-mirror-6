Description: ===================
        Grinder to Graphite
        ===================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        Grinder to Graphite (g2g) is a tool that analyzes the logs from
        your Grinder load tests, and sends the data into Graphite where it
        can be visualized in a variety of ways.
        
        Realtime test data may be sent to Graphite while your Grinder run
        is in progress, or it may be sent to Graphite after your test is
        completed.
        
        Once the data is in Graphite you have a great amount of flexibility
        in the types of reports and visualizations you want to generate.
        
        
        Who should use g2g?
        ===================
        
        g2g may be a good match for you if any of the following are 
        true:
        
         * You have access to a Graphite setup already, or you don't
           mind installing it.
        
         * You sometimes do long-duration Grinder runs and you don't
           want to wait for the run to complete before you can see
           charts of the incoming data.
        
         * You want to integrate data from The Grinder with data from a 
           variety of other sources.  (OS metrics like CPU use, application
           metrics like DB lookups per second, etc.)
