Description: 
        Convert time deltas into phrases like "5min ago",
        "3h ago", "2 days ago" etc.
        
        Base work from Adomas Paltanavicius, but with two added versions: french and "short english"
        
        This package has a number of modules in it, each for separate
        language.  It is standard that module pytimeago.X has function
        X, which accepts at least on argument -- number of seconds
        between two events.  It may also accept extra keywords, which
        should be documented in the docstring of the function.
        Returned is always unicode string.
        
        Usage pattern:
        
            from pytimeago.english import english # or other...
            from time import time, sleep
        
            a = time()
            # ...do something here...
            delta = int(time() - a)
            print "job started %s" % english(delta)
        
        Prints, e.g.
        
            job started 15mins ago
