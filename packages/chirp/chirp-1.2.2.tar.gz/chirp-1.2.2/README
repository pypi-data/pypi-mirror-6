Chirp is a set of related tools for analyzing and comparing bioacoustic
recordings. It includes the following components:

A pitch-detection algorithm that tracks the pitch of a signal as a function of
time. A number of features enable the algorithm to make stable estimates even
from very noisy signals. Performance is greatly improved by masking out noise in
the spectrotemporal domain.

Algorithms for making pairwise comparisons of signals, including spectrographic
cross-correlation, spectrographic dynamic time warping (DTW), and pitch-based
DTW.

Command-line scripts for batch, multithreaded analyses.

A graphical user interface for examining recordings and creating masks. This
program can run batch pitch analyses and perform pairwise comparisons using
pitch and other methods for large sets of recordings.
