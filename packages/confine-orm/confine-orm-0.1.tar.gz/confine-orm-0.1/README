Confine-orm (aka CONFINE Object REST Mapper, or Object Resource Mapper) is a
high level Python library for easily interacting with CONFINE REST API using
object oriented concepts.

INSTALLATION
============

pip install confine-orm


DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
=====================

The main goal of this library is to provide a fast and easy access to
CONFINE REST API: open a Python interpreter and start interacting right away.

To achieve this goal we have borowed some ideas from traditional SQL object
relational mappers and applied to an hypermedia-driven resource-oriented
architecture (CONFINE).

This library has been heavily inspired by Django's ORM implementation; also
using an Active Record like pattern, plus concurrency based on asynchronous
non-blocking I/O and caching based on Identity Mapping.

Confine-orm laverages the HATEOAS discoverability of CONFINE's API; rather than
relying on a predefined knowladge, resources and methods are autodiscovered on
the fly, while browsing the API.

Our hope is that you can use this library to produce brief, readable and
efficient code in a fun and effortless way :)
