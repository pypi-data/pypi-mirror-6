Description: ==========
        SilvaForum
        ==========
        
        What is it?
        ===========
        
        SilvaForum is an extension for `Silva`_ that provides a classic
        discussion forum environment. Site visitors can create topics
        (subjects or questions) and add comments to existing
        topics.
        
        
        Using Silva Forum
        =================
        
        After enabling the Silva Forum extension you can create a *Silva
        Forum* content in the Silva Management Interface: this will be the
        forum. The public interface of the Forum allows site visitors to add
        topics (subjects) to the forum, and comments (messages) to the
        topics. The topics and comments are accessible from the management
        interface by site editors for editing and moderation purposes.
        
        Managing Access
        ===============
        
        Consulting the forum
        --------------------
        
        By default, the forum, topic and comments are viewable by
        unauthenticated people like any other Silva content. If you wish to
        restrict this, you can use the default access restriction feature of
        Silva to do so (located in the management interface, in the access tab).
        For more information about this, please consult the Silva user
        documentation.
        
        Posting new topics and comments
        -------------------------------
        
        By default you need to be authenticated to be able to post a topic or
        a comment.
        
        For unauthenticated visitors, a link on a forum or a topic will let
        them authenticate in order to be able to post.
        
        A site manager can, per forum or per topic, authorize unauthenticated
        people to post. This is configured in the management interface in
        the settings screen of the properties tab). If this option is
        activated, unauthenticated site visitors will be able to post new
        topic or comments after filling in a Captcha.
        
        The ``silva.pas.openid`` package can be installed in order to provide
        authentication via OpenID. This authentication will be sufficient to let
        site visitors post on forums and topics.
        
        Another option, anonymous posting, can be activated by site managers
        on the same screen as the unauthenticated posting. It will permit
        authenticated visitors to hide their names on the topic or comment
        they posted.
        
        Notification
        ============
        
        A site manager can, per forum or per topic, activate a subscription
        feature. If activated, this will allow visitors, after subscription, to
        receive notifications by email when a new comment is posted on a topic.
        
        If you email is known (i.e. you filled it in in Silva, or it was provided
        by your OpenID provider), you will have the possibility to directly
        subscribe yourself to a topic when you post it, or to a topic when you
        post a comment in it.
        
        Of course people can cancel their subscription when they wish to.
        
        This feature is provided by ``silva.app.subscriptions``. To have it,
        you need to enable subscriptions for the forum, just like you would
        do for other Silva content. For more information about the
        subscription feature, you can consult the Silva user documentation.

        - The Include Comments code source includes icons for comments, these
          could be added to the forum view.
        
        - Changes to make near-complete customization of the Include Comments
          code source possible with css.
        
        - Move all the include checking in view_topic.pt into one define.
        
        - Add id and topic_url to the comment object for constructing more
          sensible permalinks, going to the topic with an anchor that's the
          comment id.
        
        - Add permalink to "[user] posted"; this links to the comment in the
          topic with an anchor, not to the comment object (which is not very
          useful because there's no context).
        
        - Add a parameter field to the SMI to add a topic, which by default is
          the document title.
        
        - Put in javascript toggle button for a comment form.
        
        - Checked in Marc Petitmermet's code source to the
          SilvaForum-CodeSource branch and added it to Silva Forum code. Added
          a view_include.pt, and include.css to handle the styles of a Silva
          Document with comments. Added to the FiveViewable class a switch to
          check for an 'include' parameter that gets the code source template.
        
        - Fixed text formatting to include links, moved replace_links call
          from the view_topic.pt to the format_text method in view.py.
        
        - Put replace_links method in the view.py for searching and
          replacing links in text area of comments. Also made tests for the
          method.
        
        - Put back subject field check in view.py. Somehow it got cut in
          recent changes.
        
        - Changed the topic and comment addable priority to 4.
        
        - Changed the configure.zcml priority setting for Silva Forum to 4,
          to send it to the bottom of the addables list in the SMI select
          pulldown.
        
        - Fixed the _generate_id method which would return 'already used id'
          with id's ending in '___2'.
        
        - Removed old security code triggered with the Ajax version of the
          forum.
        
        - Fixed the pagination links to not can the add messages. Tweaked
          the the pagination code to be more efficient.
        
        - Put in jump for the preview form on a comment. Now when previewing
          the comment will jump to the last page, the same page as where it
          is added.
        
        - forum.css changes, added emoticon preview support to
          view_forum.pt, view_comment.pt subject fields.
        
        - Ah, after reverting to static forms, unicode issue persists. Found
          the error on the preview hidden inputs, and re-wrote those to
          support unicode.
        
        - Reverted to static form in view_topic.pt view.
        
        - Reverted to static form in view_forum.pt view.
        
        - Reversed order of topics newest to oldest. Added jump
          functionality. Found IE issue with Ajax forms.
        
        - Pagination right/leftdouble.gif are not included in Silva 2.0, so
          put them into the www/ of SilvaForum.
        
        - Took out all required switches from edit comment view.
        
        - Unicode problem with textareas in view_topic.pt. Did ugly hack
          doing the unicoding in the tal expression.
        
        - Took out required subject in the edit comment view by switching
          the required tag in form.form to 0.
        
        - Made datetimes smaller.
        
        - Removed emoticons directory again, only this time from svn.
        
        - Finished Adding alt tag text to emoticons.
        
        - Changed Silva Forum Thread to Silva Forum Topic and refactored
          code to use topic rather than thread.
        
        - Put jump to last and first page pagination in the view_forum.pt
        
        - Changed the topic functionality to only take topics. Opted to take
          out messages because they can't be edited in the SMI without some
          considerable changes.
        
        - Configured the view_forum.pt and view_topic.pt to get emoticons
          added in the subject field.
        
        - Added support for emoticons.

        - Several layout fixes.
