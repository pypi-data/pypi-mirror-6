Description: 
        
        This module allows users to perform segmentation within partners.
        =================================================================
        
        It uses the profiles criteria from the earlier segmentation module and improve it. 
        Thanks to the new concept of questionnaire. You can now regroup questions into a 
        questionnaire and directly use it on a partner.
        
        It also has been merged with the earlier CRM & SRM segmentation tool because they 
        were overlapping.
        
            **Note:** this module is not compatible with the module segmentation, since it's the same which has been renamed.
