Cursgame is a interface to curses for writing text based games, like
rogue-likes.

Install instructions are in INSTALL.txt

Documentations should be available in the doc/ subdirectory. You
should find there at least a texinfo version of the documentation. You
can format it to your preferred format using texinfo. But by default
we distribute cursgame along with an already formatted HTML
documentation.
You can also get a brief documentation of the modules belonging to
cursgame using the pydoc program or the builtin help().
This README file belongs to cursgame 0.2.0
