        `Mopidy <http://www.mopidy.com/>`_ extension for controlling volume on
        external Yamaha network connected receivers. Developed and tested with a Yamaha RX-V673.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install by running::
        
            sudo pip install Mopidy-Yamaha
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The Mopidy-Yamaha extension is enabled by default. To disable it, add the
        following to ``mopidy.conf``::
        
            [yamaha]
            enabled = false
        
        The Yamaha receiver must be connected to the local network and the receiver ip
        must be specified in the configuration.
        
        To use the Yamaha receiver to control volume, set the ``audio/mixer`` config
        value in ``mopidy.conf`` to ``yamahamixer``. You probably also needs to add some
        properties to the ``audio/mixer`` config value.
        
        Supported properties includes:
        
        - ``host``: The ip or hostname to the receiver.
        
        - ``source``: The source that should be selected on the amplifier, like
          ``HDMI1``, ``AV_1``, ``AUDIO_1``, etc. Leave unset if you don't want
          the mixer to change it for you.
        
        Configuration examples::
        
            # Minimum configuration, if the amplifier is available at IP 192.168.1.15
            [audio]
            mixer = yamahamixer host=192.168.1.15
        
            # Full configuration
            [audio]
            mixer = yamahamixer host=192.168.1.15 source=HDMI2
