.\" ------ DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fIcopy\fR module copies a file on the local box to remote locations. 
.\" ------ OPTIONS
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
   
.IP backup
Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
.IR Choices :
yes,no. (default: no)(Added in Ansible version 0.7.)
   
.IP content
When used instead of 'src', sets the contents of a file directly to the specified value.(Added in Ansible version 1.1.)
   
.IP dest
Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If src is a directory, this must be a directory too.(required)   
.IP force
the default is \fCyes\fR, which will replace the remote file when contents are different than the source.  If \fCno\fR, the file will only be transferred if the destination does not exist.
.IR Choices :
yes,no. (default: yes)(Added in Ansible version 1.1.)
   
.IP others
all arguments accepted by the \fIfile\fR module also work here   
.IP src
Local path to a file to copy to the remote server; can be absolute or relative. If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends with "/", only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the directory itself with all contents is copied. This behavior is similar to Rsync.   
.IP validate
The validation command to run before copying into place.  The path to the file to validate is passed in via '%s' which must be present as in the visudo example below.(Added in Ansible version 1.2.)

.PP
The "copy" module recursively copy facility does not scale to lots (>hundreds) of files. For alternative, see "Delegation" section of the Advanced Playbooks documentation.

# Copy a new "ntp.conf file into place, backing up the original if it differs from the copied version
- copy: src=/mine/ntp.conf dest=/etc/ntp.conf owner=root group=root mode=644 backup=yes

# Copy a new "sudoers" file into place, after passing validation with visudo
