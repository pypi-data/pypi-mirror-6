Description: txOneDrive
        ----------
        
        Twisted-based python async interface for `OneDrive API (version
        5.0) <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/live/hh826521>`_ (formerly
        known as SkyDrive).
        
        API is mostly the same as in
        `python-onedrive <https://github.com/mk-fg/python-onedrive>`_ module
        (txOneDriveAPI class maps to OneDriveAPIWrapper, txOneDrive to
        OneDriveAPI) - methods are re-used directly from classes there, so more
        info on these can be found in that project.
        
        Key difference from synchronous python-onedrive module is that all
        methods return twisted Deferred objects as scheduled to run by event
        loop, allowing to run multiple operations (like large file uploads)
        concurrently within one python process.
        
        Service was called SkyDrive prior to 2014-02-19, when it got renamed to
        OneDrive. This package similarly renamed from txskydrive to txonedrive.
        
        Usage Example
        -------------
        
        Following script will print listing of the root OneDrive folder, upload
        "test.txt" file there, try to find it in updated folder listing and then
        remove it.
        
        ::
        
            from twisted.internet import defer, reactor
            from txonedrive import txOneDrivePersistent
        
            @defer.inlineCallbacks
            def do_stuff():
                api = txOneDrivePersistent.from_conf()
        
                # Print root directory ("me/skydrive") listing
                print (e['name'] for e in (yield api.listdir()))
        
                # Upload "test.txt" file from local current directory
                file_info = yield api.put('test.txt')
        
                # Find just-uploaded "test.txt" file by name
                file_id = yield api.resolve_path('test.txt')
        
                # Check that id matches uploaded file
                assert file_info['id'] == file_id
        
                # Remove the file
                yield api.delete(file_id)
        
            do_stuff().addBoth(lambda ignored: reactor.stop())
            reactor.run()
        
        Note that txOneDriveAPIPersistent convenience class uses Microsoft
        LiveConnect authentication data from "~/.lcrc" file, which must be
        created as described in more detail `in python-onedrive
        docs <https://github.com/mk-fg/python-onedrive#command-line-usage>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It's a regular package for Python 2.7 (not 3.X).
        
        Using `pip <http://pip-installer.org/>`_ is the best way:
        
        ::
        
            % pip install txonedrive
        
        If you don't have it, use:
        
        ::
        
            % easy_install pip
            % pip install txonedrive
        
        Alternatively (`see
        also <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_):
        
        ::
        
            % curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python
            % pip install txonedrive
        
        Or, if you absolutely must:
        
        ::
        
            % easy_install txonedrive
        
        But, you really shouldn't do that.
        
        Current-git version can be installed like this:
        
        ::
        
            % pip install 'git+https://github.com/mk-fg/txonedrive.git#egg=txonedrive'
        
        Note that to install stuff in system-wide PATH and site-packages,
        elevated privileges are often required. Use "install --user",
        `~/.pydistutils.cfg <http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#distutils-configuration-files>`_
        or `virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ to do
        unprivileged installs into custom paths.
