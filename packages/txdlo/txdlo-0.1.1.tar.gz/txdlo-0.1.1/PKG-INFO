Description: txdlo - a (Twisted) deferred list observer
        ==========================================
        
        ``txdlo`` is a Python package that provides a class called
        ``DeferredListObserver``.
        
        As you might guess, ``DeferredListObserver`` lets you observe callback and
        errback events from a list of `Twisted <http://twistedmatrix.com>`_
        `deferreds <http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer.html>`_.
        You can add observers that will be passed information about deferreds
        firing.  You can add deferreds to the observed list at any time, which is
        very useful if you're dynamically creating deferreds that you want to
        monitor.
        
        The class can be used to easily build functions or classes that provide
        deferreds that fire when arbitrary combinations of events from the observed
        deferreds have occurred.
        
        For example you can write functions or classes that support deferreds that
        
        * Implement Twisted's ``DeferredList`` or simple variants of it, or that let
          you separate the various behaviors of ``DeferredList`` into simpler
          functions.
        * Provide a deferred that fires when N of the observed deferreds have fired.
        * Provide a deferred that ignores errors until one of the observed deferred
          succeeds, only firing with an error if all the observed deferreds fail.
        * Or (a more involved example), suppose you have 3 methods that can return
          you a user's avatar: a fast local cache, a filesystem, and a slow network
          call to Gravatar. You want to write a deferred-returning function that
          launches all three lookups at once and fires its deferred with the first
          answer. But if the cache and/or filesystems fails first, you don't want
          to trigger an error, you instead want to take the result from Gravatar
          and add it to the cache and/or filesystem, as well firing the returned
          deferred with the result (wherever it comes from). Only if all three
          lookups fail do you want to errback the deferred you returned.
