        ======
        
        A Fortran 90 namelist parser
        
        
        About f90nml
        ============
        
        The f90nml_ module takes a Fortran 90 namelist file and parses it into a Python
        ``dict`` of namelist groups, each containing a ``dict`` of its variables.
        Fortran data types are converted to equivalent Python types.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To read a Fortran namelist file as a ``dict``, use the ``read()`` method:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           nml_dict = f90nml.read(nml_filename)
        
        To output a Python ``dict`` as a Fortran namelist file, use the ``write()``
        method:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           f90nml.write(my_nml, output_filename)
        
        This method will abort if the output file already exists.
        
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        The ``read`` method produces an ``NmlDict``, which behaves as a ``dict`` with
        case-insensitive keys, due to the case insensitivity of Fortran. This
        implementation is currently not a true case-insensitive ``dict``, and is only
        intended to accomodate individual references and assignments.
        
        The following namelist features are currently not supported:
        
        * Index range support (``v(i:j) = c``)
        * Repeated indexing (``v = r*c, r*``)
        * Upcast vector elements if components differ (``x(i) = int, x(j) = float``)
        * Escape on repeated quotes (``'This doesn''t parse correctly'``)
        * Type character resolver (``x%y = c``)
        * stdin/stdout support (``?``, ``?=``)
