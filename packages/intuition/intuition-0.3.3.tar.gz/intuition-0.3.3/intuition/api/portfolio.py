    Manages portfolio during simulation, and stays aware of the situation
    through the update() method.

    User strategies call it with a dictionnnary of detected opportunities (i.e.
    buy or sell signals).  Then the optimize function computes assets
    allocation, returning a dictionnary of symbols with their weigths or amount
    to reallocate.

    {'buy': zipline.Positions}    __________________________      _____________
    signals                   --> |                         | -> |            |

    orders  {'google': 34}    <-- |_________________________| <- |____________|

    This is abstract class, inheretid class will eventally overwrite optmize()
    to expose their own asset allocation strategy.
