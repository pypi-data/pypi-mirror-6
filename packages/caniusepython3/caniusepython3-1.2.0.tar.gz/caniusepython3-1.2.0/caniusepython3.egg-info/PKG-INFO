Description: Can I Use Python 3?
        ===================
        
        This script takes in a set of dependencies and then figures out which
        of them are holding you up from porting to Python 3.
        
        You can specify your dependencies in multiple ways::
        
            caniusepython3 -r requirements.txt,test-requirement.txt
            caniusepython3 -m PKG-INFO
            caniusepython3 -p numpy,scipy,ipython
            # If your project's setup.py uses setuptools ...
            python setup.py caniusepython3
        
        The output of the script will tell you how many (implicit) dependencies you need
        to transition to Python 3 in order to allow you to make the same transition. It
        will also list what projects have no explicit dependency blocking their
        transition so you can ask them consider starting a port to Python 3.
