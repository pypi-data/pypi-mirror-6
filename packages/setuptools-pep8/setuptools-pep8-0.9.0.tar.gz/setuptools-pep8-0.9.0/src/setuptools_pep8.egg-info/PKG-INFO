        This package exposes the `pep8`_ style guide checker as a
        sub-command of setup.py::
        
            $ cat setup.py
            ...
                setup(
                    name='your project',
                    setup_requires=['setuptools-pep8']
                )
            ....
            $ cat setup.cfg
            ...
            [pep8]
            ignore=E225
            ...
            $ python setup.py pep8
            running pep8
            ./setup.py:41:1: W391 blank line at end of file
        
        This invokes ``pep8`` and applies any configuration from your
        ``setup.cfg`` file's ``[pep8]`` section. Typical use cases
        include simplification of continuous-integration job configurations.

        ====
        
        0.9.0
        -----
        
        *Release date: 29-Dec-2013*
        
        Final major release before v1.0 (project goes into maint mode).
        
        **Contains non-backwards-compatable changes!**
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        * Resolves clash with setuptools Command --verbose flag
        
        Features:
        
        * All pep8 cmdline options can now be specified on the ``python
          setup.py pep8`` command line
        * pep8 return code is propagated to the ``python setup.py`` command
          return code
        
        Non-Functional Changes:
        
        * Drastic simplification of pep8 setuptools Command implementation
        * Minor changes to testing code (adopt usage of process return code)
        
        Backwards Incompatable Changes:
        
        * --pep8-output option has been removed. Replace usage of this with
          shell redirection.
        * --check-dirs option has been removed. Replace usage of this with
          pep8's --exclude option.
        
        Any users wishing to retain these features are advised to stay on
        version 0.2.0.
