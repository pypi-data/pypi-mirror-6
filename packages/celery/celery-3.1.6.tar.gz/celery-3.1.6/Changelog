.. _version-3.1.6:

3.1.6
=====
:release-date: 2013-12-02 6:00 P.M UTC
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Now depends on :mod:`billiard` 3.3.0.10.

- Now depends on :ref:`Kombu 3.0.7 <kombu:version-3.0.7>`.

- Fixed problem where Mingle caused the worker to hang at startup
  (Issue #1686).

- Beat: Would attempt to drop privileges twice (Issue #1708).

- Windows: Fixed error with ``geteuid`` not being available (Issue #1676).

- Tasks can now provide a list of expected error classes (Issue #1682).

    The list should only include errors that the task is expected to raise
    during normal operation::

        @task(throws=(KeyError, HttpNotFound))

    What happens when an exceptions is raised depends on the type of error:

    - Expected errors (included in ``Task.throws``)

        Will be logged using severity ``INFO``, and traceback is excluded.

    - Unexpected errors

        Will be logged using severity ``ERROR``, with traceback included.

- Cache result backend now compatible with Python 3 (Issue #1697).

- CentOS init script: Now compatible with sys-v style init symlinks.

    Fix contributed by Jonathan Jordan.

- Events: Fixed problem when task name is not defined (Issue #1710).

    Fix contributed by Mher Movsisyan.

- Task: Fixed unbound local errors (Issue #1684).

    Fix contributed by Markus Ullmann.

- Canvas: Now unrolls groups with only one task (optimization) (Issue #1656).

- Task: Fixed problem with eta and timezones.

    Fix contributed by Alexander Koval.

- Django: Worker now performs model validation (Issue #1681).

- Task decorator now emits less confusing errors when used with
  incorrect arguments (Issue #1692).

- Task: New method ``Task.send_event`` can be used to send custom events
  to Flower and other monitors.

- Fixed a compatibility issue with non-abstract task classes

- Events from clients now uses new node name format (``gen<pid>@<hostname>``).

- Fixed rare bug with Callable not being defined at interpreter shutdown
  (Issue #1678).

    Fix contributed by Nick Johnson.

- Fixed Python 2.6 compatibility (Issue #1679).

.. _version-3.1.5:

3.1.5
=====
:release-date: 2013-11-21 6:20 P.M UTC
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Now depends on :ref:`Kombu 3.0.6 <kombu:version-3.0.6>`.

- Now depends on :mod:`billiard` 3.3.0.8

- App: ``config_from_object`` is now lazy (Issue #1665).

- App: ``autodiscover_tasks`` is now lazy.

    Django users should now wrap access to the settings object
    in a lambda::

        app.autodiscover_tasks(lambda: settings.INSTALLED_APPS)

    this ensures that the settings object is not prepared
    prematurely.

- Fixed regression for ``--app`` argument experienced by
  some users (Issue #1653).

- Worker: Now respects the ``--uid`` and ``--gid`` arguments
  even if ``--detach`` is not enabled.

- Beat: Now respects the ``--uid`` and ``--gid`` arguments
  even if ``--detach`` is not enabled.

- Python 3: Fixed unorderable error occuring with the worker ``-B``
  argument enabled.

- ``celery.VERSION`` is now a named tuple.

- ``maybe_signature(list)`` is now applied recursively (Issue #1645).

- ``celery shell`` command: Fixed ``IPython.frontend`` deprecation warning.

- The default app no longer includes the builtin fixups.

    This fixes a bug where ``celery multi`` would attempt
    to load the Django settings module before entering
    the target working directory.

- The Django daemonization tutorial was changed.

    Users no longer have to explicitly export ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``
    in :file:`/etc/default/celeryd` when the new project layout is used.

- Redis result backend: expiry value can now be 0 (Issue #1661).

- Censoring settings now accounts for non-string keys (Issue #1663).

- App: New ``autofinalize`` option.

    Apps are automatically finalized when the task registry is accessed.
    You can now disable this behavior so that an exception is raised
    instead.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        app = Celery(autofinalize=False)

        # raises RuntimeError
        tasks = app.tasks

        @app.task
        def add(x, y):
            return x + y

        # raises RuntimeError
        add.delay(2, 2)

        app.finalize()
        # no longer raises:
        tasks = app.tasks
        add.delay(2, 2)

- The worker did not send monitoring events during shutdown.

- Worker: Mingle and gossip is now automatically disabled when
  used with an unsupported transport (Issue #1664).

- ``celery`` command:  Preload options now supports
  the rare ``--opt value`` format (Issue #1668).

- ``celery`` command: Accidentally removed options
  appearing before the subcommand, these are now moved to the end
  instead.

- Worker now properly responds to ``inspect stats`` commands
  even if received before startup is complete (Issue #1659).

- :signal:`task_postrun` is now sent within a finally block, to make
  sure the signal is always sent.

- Beat: Fixed syntax error in string formatting.

    Contributed by nadad.

- Fixed typos in the documentation.

    Fixes contributed by Loic Bistuer, sunfinite.

- Nested chains now works properly when constructed using the
  ``chain`` type instead of the ``|`` operator (Issue #1656).

.. _version-3.1.4:

- Now depends on :ref:`Kombu 3.0.5 <kombu:version-3.0.5>`.

- Now depends on :mod:`billiard` 3.3.0.7

- Worker accidentally set a default socket timeout of 5 seconds.

- Django: Fixup now sets the default app so that threads will use
  the same app instance (e.g. for manage.py runserver).

- Worker: Fixed Unicode error crash at startup experienced by some users.

- Calling ``.apply_async`` on an empty chain now works again (Issue #1650).

- The ``celery multi show`` command now generates the same arguments
  as the start command does.

- The ``--app`` argument could end up using a module object instead
  of an app instance (with a resulting crash).

- Fixed a syntax error problem in the celerybeat init script.

    Fix contributed by Vsevolod.

- Tests now passing on PyPy 2.1 and 2.2.

:release-by: Ask Solem

    ``unpack_from`` started supporting ``memoryview`` arguments
    in Python 2.7.6.

- Worker: :option:`-B` argument accidentally closed files used
  for logging.

- Task decorated tasks now keep their docstring (Issue #1636)

  when no database backend specified.

    Fix contributed by j0hnsmith

- Windows:  Accidentally showed warning that the billiard C extension
  was not installed (Issue #1630).

- Django: Tutorial updated with a solution that sets a default
  :envvar:`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` so that it doesn't have to be typed
  in with the :program:`celery` command.

    Also fixed typos in the tutorial, and added the settings
    required to use the Django database backend.

    Thanks to Chris Ward, orarbel.

- Django: Fixed a problem when using the Django settings in Django 1.6.
