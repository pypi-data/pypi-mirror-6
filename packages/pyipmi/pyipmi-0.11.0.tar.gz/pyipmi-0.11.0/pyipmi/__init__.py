    Tool is an abstract class - it needs a 'run' method defined to be useful.

    Tool implementations vary in the way they implement IPMI communications.

    subprocesses. A freeipmi implementation could do the same using freeipmi
    commands, or there could be a RawIpmiTool implementation that used IpmiTool
    with raw commands. Another possibility is implementing IPMI natively in
    python, and having a NativeIpmi Tool implementation for that.

    Tool instances are bound to handle instances - each tool has exactly one
    handle.

    Tool instances are created with a list of commands - each command in the
    list causes a method (named after the command) to be added to the tool
    for executing the command. Commands in the list must implement support
    for the tool - each tool has

    Concrete implementations should go in the tools directory. An example
    concrete implementation is the ImpiTool class.
