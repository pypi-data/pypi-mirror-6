Description: 
            PySoundCard can play and record audio.
        
            Audio devices are supported through PortAudio_, which is a free,
            cross-platform, open-source audio I/O library that runs on many
            operating systems including Windows, OS X and Linux. It is
            accessed through CFFI_, which is a foreign function interface for
            Python calling C code. CFFI is supported for CPython 2.6+, 3.x and
            PyPy 2.0+. PySoundCard represents audio data as NumPy arrays.
        
            You must have PortAudio installed in order to run PySoundCard.
