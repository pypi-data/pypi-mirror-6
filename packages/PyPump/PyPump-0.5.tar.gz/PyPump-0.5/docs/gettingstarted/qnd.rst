Introduction
------------

.. warning:: This is not complete, this is used as a fast intro for those fairly familiar or a reference for those who are a little rusty with PyPump

This guide is designed to get you up to speed and using this library in a very short amount of time, to do that I avoid long winded explanations, if you're completely new to PyPump and/or pump.io please use :doc:`tutorial`.

Getting connected
-----------------

So we need to get started::

    >>> from pypump import PyPump, Client

As Part of our application we will need to ask the user to input a verification code
from the website to give us access as part of the OAuth mechamism, the function needs
to take a URL and have the user allow our application this function can either return
the verification code or you can call pump.verify(code), a simple code::

    >>> def simple_verifier(url):
    ...     print 'Please follow the instructions at the following URL:'
    ...     print url
    ...     return raw_input("Verifier: ") # the verifier is a string

.. note:: If you wish to call pump.verify(<verification code>) return None from your verifier function

First we must tell the server about ourselves::

    >>> client = Client(
        webfinger="me@my.server.tld",
        name="Quick 'n dirty",
        type="native" # can be "native" or "web"
        )

Now make PyPump (the class for talking to pump)::

    >>> pump = PyPump(client=client, verifier_callback=simple_verifier)

Super, next, I wanna see my inbox::

    >>> my_inbox = pump.me.inbox
    >>> for activity in my_inbox[:20]:
    ...     print(activity)

.. note:: iterating over the inbox without any slice will iterate until the very first note in your inbox/feed/outbox

Oh, my friend Evan isn't there, I probably need to follow him::

    >>> evan = pump.Person("evan@e14n.org")
    >>> evan.follow()

Awesome. Lets check again::

    >>> for activity in my_inbox[:20]:
    ...     print(activity)

Evan likes PyPump, super!::

    >>> activity = my_inbox[1] # second activity in my inbox
    >>> awesome_note = activity.obj
    >>> awesome_note.content
    'Oh wow, PyPump is awesome!'
    >>> awesome_note.like()

I wonder if someone else has liked that::

    >>> awesome_note.likes
    [me@my.server.org, joar@some.other.server]

Cool! Lets tell them about these docs::

    >>> my_comment = pump.Comment("Guys, if you like PyPump check out the docs!")
    >>> awesome_note.comment(my_comment)

I wonder what was posted last::

    >>> latest_activity = my_inbox[0]
    >>> print(latest_activity)
    <Activity: jrobb posted an image>

Oh it's an image, lets see the thumbnail::

    >>> url = latest_activity.obj.thumbnail.url
    >>> fout = open("some_image.{0}".format(url.split(".")[-1], "wb")
    >>> import urllib2 # this will be different with python3
    >>> fout.write(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
    >>> fout.close()

Hmm, I want to see a bigger version::

    >>> large_url = latest_activity.obj.original.url
    >>> print(large_url)
    <Image at https://some.server/uploads/somefriend/2013/7/7/JkdX2.png">
    >>> # you will find Images often hold other pump.Image objects, we just need to extra the url
    >>> large_url = large_url.url
    >>> fout = open("some_image_larger.{0}".format(large_url.split(".")[-1], "wb")
    >>> fout.write(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
    >>> fout.close()

That looks awesome, lets post a comment::

    >>> my_comment = pump.Comment("Great, super imaeg")
    >>> latest_activity.obj.comment(my_comment)

Oh no, I made a typo::

    >>> my_comment.delete()
    >>> my_comment.content = "Great, super image")
    >>> latest_activity.obj.comment(my_comment)

Much better! Lets make a note to tell people how easy this all is::

    >>> my_note = pump.Note("My gawd... PyPump is super easy to get started with")
    >>> my_note.send()

But hold on though, that only sent it to followers? What gives::

    >>> awesome_pump = pump.Note("PyPump is really awesome!")
    >>> awesome_pump.to = pump.Public
    >>> awesome_pump.cc = (pump.me.followers, pump.Person("MyFriend@server.com"))
    >>> awesome_pump.send()

Oh cool that's sent to all my friends, So can i make my own lists::

    >>> for my_list in pump.me.lists:
    ...    print(my_list)
    Coworkers
    Family
    Friends

Oh are all those my lists that are defined. How do I send a note to them?::

    >>> new_note = pump.Note("Work sucks!")
    >>> new_note.to = pump.me.lists["Coworkers"]
    >>> new_note.cc = pump.me.lists["Friends"]

So, can i send something to all of of the groups I made? Yep::

    >>> another_note = pump.Note("This really goes to everyone in my groups?")
    >>> another_note.to = list(pump.me.lists)
    >>> another_note.cc = (pump.Person("moggers87@microca.st"), pump.Person("cwebber@identi.ca"))
    >>> another_note.send()
