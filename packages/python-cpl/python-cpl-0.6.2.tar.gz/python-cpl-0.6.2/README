Python interface for the Common Pipeline Library.

This module can list, configure and execute CPL-based recipes from Python.
The input, calibration and output data can be specified as FITS files
or as astropy.io.fits objects in memory.

The Common Pipeline Library (CPL) comprises a set of ISO-C libraries that
provide a comprehensive, efficient and robust software toolkit. It forms a
basis for the creation of automated astronomical data-reduction tasks. One of
the features provided by the CPL is the ability to create data-reduction
algorithms that run as plugins (dynamic libraries). These are called "recipes"
and are one of the main aspects of the CPL data-reduction development
environment. More information about the CPL can be found here:

The interface may be used to run ESO pipeline recipes linked to CPL 
versions 4.0 to 6.3.1.

Build instructions
------------------

python-cpl requires:

   - Python 2.6 or later
   - astropy or pyfits

python-cpl uses the standard Python distutils system to build and install
itself.  From the command line run::

    python setup.py install

to install python-cpl.
