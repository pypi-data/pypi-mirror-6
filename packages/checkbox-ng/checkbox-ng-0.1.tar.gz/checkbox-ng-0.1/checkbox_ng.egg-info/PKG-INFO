Description: CheckBoxNG
        ==========
        
        :term:`CheckBoxNG` is a hardware testing tool useful for certifying laptops,
        desktops and servers with Ubuntu. It is a new version of :term:`CheckBox` that
        is built directly on top of :term:`PlainBox`
        
        CheckBoxNG *replaces* CheckBox, where applicable. 
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation is a bit tricky. You need to have python3-plainbox installed first
        (which may come from the checkbox daily ppa) or you need to (recommended, for
        the time being) develop plainbox.
