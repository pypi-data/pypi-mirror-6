ChangeLog
=========

  an external source.

  "External Source <<title>>" div.

2.2a2 (2009-01-12)
------------------

Features Added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a citation external source, to replace the citation element.

  rendering script as strings instead of lists

  instead.

2.1
---

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``install_codesources`` function to install codesources
  from the file system.

2.0.9
-----

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- html entered into parameters is no lounger doubly escaped on saving
  the document.

2.0.7
-----

Features Added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- added support for 'elaborate' code sources, that show their
  add/edit form in a pop-up instead of in the kupu
  toolbox. Useful when code sources have a large number of
  variables.

- component registration now done using Silva 2.0 zcml
  directives SilvaExternalSources no longer works with Silva 1.6
  or lower.

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- SilvaExternalSources now depends on SilvaDocument (in
  configure.zcml) since attempting to add this product will fail
  if SilvaDocument isn't installed.

- fixed sql source "show caption" and "show table column
  headings" parameters.

- problem with checkboxfields (checked) when rendering a code
  source.

- #106231 Integer field of Code Sources cannot be empty Empty
  Integer fields now have a value of None.

- #180860 code source parameter ids must be lowercase They can
  now be mixed case.  However, multiple parameters with ids that
  differ only in case aren't supported.

1.5
---

Bugs Fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The model is available in ``validate_to_form`` (when working from
  kupu).

1.4
---

Features added / bugs fixed: not recorded

---

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated to work with Zope 2.10.

1.2
---

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Users get confused when adding a Code Source that has no
  parameters.  They have to click the same button twice, once to
  add, and again to add.  Added a note that informs the user how
  to proceed.

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The add form for CSV Sources was broken in that it ignored the
  file upload field.

- CheckBox parameters in Code Sources now work as expected.
  (Thanks Benno!)

0.13
----

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed Silva External Sources to use new i18n machinery.

- Available code sources are sorted on title when presented as a list.

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Titles were not stored as unicode strings.
  Moved the setting of the title to *after* the creation
  of the source, so that we can get an encoding from somewhere
  and use it to convert to unicode. Unfortunately this somewhere is a
  hard coded string for now, since Zope 2 doesn't seem to allow
  anything else.

- ZMI parameter forms are now utf-8 by default.

- Fixed unicode bug when using non-ascii chars in field titles (Kupu
  specific, port from 0.10 branch).

0.12
----

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes to security declarations to stop Zope 2.8.5+ startup warnings.

- Some HTML template cleanups.

- Import registerDirectory from Silva's fssite.

0.11
----

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Silva 1.5 (Zope 2.8) compatibility fixes.

0.10.3
------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed unicode bug in SQL statement, this didn't support non-ascii
  characters yet.

- Fixed conditionals in the layout template, setting ``show_caption`` and
  ``show_column_heading`` should now have an effect.

0.10.2
------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed typo in add_submit script for CSVSource.

- Fixed issue1257, context problems in Kupu, Kupu code now uses the same code
  to find code sources as the rest of Silva.

0.10.1
------

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed missing import for Silva.i18n.translate

0.10
----

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- i18n, German translation.

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The layout pagetemplate for rendering the SQL result set now
  gets more information about the columns names and their
  order. The pagetemplates of existing SQL Source instances need
  to be updated to make use of this information.

0.9.1
-----

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Silva 1.1 compatibility.

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for default values in the Kupu editor tool.

- XML exporter for external source-based data in documents. Needed to
  support Silva's XSLT rendering.

0.8

0.8b1
-----

Features added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Kupu support.

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

- The description could not be set empty. It can now.

- The ZMI screens for the ExternalSource objects are now set
  to be in utf-8. This way we can make save assumption for
  decoding the user input into unicode.

Lots of additions and bugfixes, including new CVSSource object.

0.2
---

Initial public release.
