Available commands
==================

Login
-----

Uploading a click package requires the developer to submit
an oauth signed request. For this, click-toolbelt needs to first
obtain an oauth token. In order to do so, the user can run the
following (note: be sure to prepend the command with a space so that
your command history doesn't save the sensitive command).

::

    $   click-toolbelt login <email> <password> [otp]


On successful execution this command will store the oauth credentials
in ``$HOME/.config/click-toolbelt/click.cfg`` and will use it during the
upload step.


Upload
------

Once the user is successfully logged in, he can then upload
the click package for an already existing application. In order to do
so, the user can run

::

    $ click-toolbelt upload <binary_file> [--source <source_file] [--metadata <metadata_file>]


For this command to be successful, certain criteria must be met:

- user must be logged in already (see `Login`_)
- the binary file must be a valid click package
- the application must have been registered previously
- user owns the application for which he's uploading the click package

The optional ``source_file`` parameter should refer to a compressed file of the full source tree.

The ``metadata_file`` parameter should refer to a file containing a json document. If this file is provided,
it will be used to extract extra information not provided in the click package's manifest.

For a new version upload, the ``metadata_file`` file will only be scanned for the following fields:

- changelog: A description of the changes included since the last upload


Register
--------

While the ``upload`` command works for existing applications, when the developer wants
to register a new application, he can instead use the ``register`` command, like this

::

    $ click-toolbelt register <binary_file> [--source <source_file>] [--metadata <metadata_file>]


For this command to succeed, certain criteria must be met:

- user must be logged in already (see `Login`_)
- the binary file must be a valid click package
- the application must not be registered already

The optional ``source_file`` parameter should refer to a compressed file of the full source tree.

The ``metadata_file`` parameter should refer to a file containing a json document. If this file is not provided,
the application will be registered but will remain in a Draft state where manual interaction via
the `Developer Portal`_ is needed before it can be submitted for review.

The ``metadata_file`` file should contain at least the following attributes in order to complete registration:

- tagline: A one line summary for the app
- department: The app's category name (see `Department`_)
- support_url: A URL users can go to for support for this application. Allows http(s): and mailto: schemes
- license: The license under which the app will be released (see `License`_)
- icon_256 (or icon): The path to a local file to be uploaded as the icon for the application; the icon must be 256x256 px in size

Additionally, it supports the following optional attributes:

- name: Application name (overrides what's defined in the click package manifest)
- description: Application description (overrides what's defined in the click package manifest)
- changelog: A description of the changes included since the last upload
- screenshots: A list of paths to local files to be uploaded as screenshots for the application
- blacklist_ids: A list of country codes to prevent the application from being distributed to (see `Country`_)
- whitelist_ids: A list of country codes to limit the application being distributed to (see `Country`_)
- auto_publish: Automatically submit for review
- reviewer_notes: Notes for reviewers to use when reviewing the app's submission
