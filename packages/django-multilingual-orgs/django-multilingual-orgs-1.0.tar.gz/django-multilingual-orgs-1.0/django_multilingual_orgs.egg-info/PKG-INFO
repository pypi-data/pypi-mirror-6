Description: Django Multilingual Orgs
        ========================
        
        An app for showing localized versions of organization profiles. E.g. as plugin
        in a blog post.
        
        Comes with a django-cms plugin and is multilingual.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        You will need to have the following packages installed:
        
        * django-cms (cms 3 beta ready)
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you want to install the latest stable release from PyPi::
        
            $ pip install django-multilingual-orgs
        
        If you feel adventurous and want to install the latest commit from GitHub::
        
            $ pip install -e git://github.com/bitmazk/django-multilingual-orgs.git#egg=multilingual_orgs
        
        Add ``multilingual_orgs`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...,
                'multilingual_orgs',
            )
        
        Run the South migrations::
        
            ./manage.py migrate multilingual_orgs
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Use the Django admin to create your organization objects. If you are using
        django-cms you can use the ``Organization Plugin`` to display an organization
        in your placeholders.
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        ORGANIZATION_PLUGIN_DISPLAY_TYPE_CHOICES
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        Default::
        
            [
                ('small', _('small')),
                ('big', _('big')),
            ]
        
        When using the ``Organization Plugin`` in your django-cms placeholders you will
        notice that you only have two choices for the ``Display type``. This field
        can be helpful when you want to render an organization differently in different
        parts of your site. If you need even more display types, just set this setting
        to a different list of tuples.
