Interface
---------

- add a GTK interfacer that is used instead of TK if installed

Stream

- add options for X and Y offsets

- use a less CPU / GPU intensive stream format

  - as size propbly doesn't matter much in the local network

  - that still works with XBMC

- check if voiceover audio (headset) is captured
