        ==============
         Installation
        ==============
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        * You only need Python 2.7.x.
        
          * Other Python versions are currently not supported.
        
          * For a smooth installation ensure your Python installation is clean by
        
            * either compiling your own Python 2.7 from the `source code`_
        
            * or by creating a `virtualenv`_.
        
        .. _`source code` : http://www.python.org/download/releases/
        
        .. _`virtualenv` : https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
        
        There are two variants for installation:
        
          * Package installation (to be preferred)
        
          * Source installation (for development)
        
        Package installation
        ====================
        
        Follow these steps if you want to install the pre-packaged address book
        (preferred way):
        
        First installation
        ------------------
        
        CAUTION: icemac.addressbook can't be installed using ``easy_install`` or
        ``pip``, you have to follow these simple steps.
        
        Neither you need any root privileges nor it installs anything outside
        its directory.
        
        1. Download the source distribution (see Download_).
        
        2. Extract the downloaded file.
        
        3. Run ``install.py`` using your desired python, e. g.::
        
           $ python2.7 install.py
        
        4. Answer the questions about admin user name, password and so on.
        
        5. Run the tests. See `Run the tests`_
        
        6. Start the application. See `Run the application`_
        
        Update
        ------
        
        - If you are updating from version 0.x get the latest 1.x version from
          `PyPI`_ and follow the update procedure described there in INSTALL.rst.
        
        - If you are updating from version 1.x or newer follow these steps:
        
           1. Download and extract the source distribution (see Download_) to a
           new a directory.
        
           2. Run ``install.py`` using your desired python added by the path
           to the previous installation. This way values you entered
           previously are used as defaults instead of the application
           defaults.  Example::
        
             $ python2.7 install.py ../icemac.addressbook-1.10.6
        
           3. Answer the questions about admin user name, password and so on.
        
           4. Start the new instance of the application.
        
        .. _`PyPI` : https://pypi.python.org/simple/icemac.addressbook
        
        Source installation
        ===================
        
        1. Get the source code::
        
           $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/icemac/icemac.addressbook
        
        2. Install the sources::
        
           $ cd icemac.addressbook
           $ printf "[buildout]\nextends = profiles/%s\n" dev.cfg > buildout.cfg
           $ python2.7 bootstrap.py
           $ bin/buildout
        
        
        Run the tests
        =============
        
        Running the tests is independent from your choosen installation kind.
        
        Unit tests and functional tests
        -------------------------------
        
        Run the unit tests and functional tests using::
        
          $ bin/test
        
        Selenium tests
        --------------
        
        To run the Selenium tests you additionally need:
        
        * Selenium Server from SeleniumHQ_
        
        * Firefox with a version between 7 and 17 (newer versions lead to test
          errors!)
        
        Run the tests following these steps:
        
        * set the variable `GOCEPT_SELENIUM_BROWSER` like this::
        
          $ export GOCEPT_SELENIUM_BROWSER='*firefox <Path to Firefox binary>'
        
        * start the server::
        
          $ java -jar <Path to Selenium Server jar>
        
        * run all tests using::
        
          $ bin/test --all
        
        .. _SeleniumHQ: http://seleniumhq.org/download/
        
        Run the application
        ===================
        
        Running the application is independent from your choosen installation kind.
        
        To run the application instance in foreground start using::
        
          $ bin/addressbook fg
        
        To run it as a demon process start using::
        
          $ bin/addressbook start
        
        To stop the demon process call::
        
          $ bin/addressbook stop
        
        The default URL is to access the application is::
        
          http://127.0.0.1:8080
        
        To log-in at this URL you need a username and password.
        
         * If you installed via package installation you had to chose them when
           running ``install.py``. They are stored in ``admin.zcml``.
        
         * If you installed the sources you find username and password in
           ``dev_admin_user.zcml``.
        
        Create a new address book using the `add address book` link on the
        right. How to create new users inside this address book is described
        in `Create new users`_.
        
        
        Change configuration of the installation
        ========================================
        
        This section is only valid if you chose package installation.
        
        The values you entered during installation resp. update are stored in
        a file named `install.user.ini` in the address book directory.
        
        To change the configuration values call `install.py` using python and
        enter a `.` as parameter like this::
        
          $ python2.7 install.py .
        
        The configuration questions get presented to you with your previously
        entered values as default.
        
        To remove additional packages you have to edit the ``[package]``
        section of `install.user.ini`. There is currently no other way for
        removal.
        
        To remove the user name which should own the process you have to edit the
        ``[server]`` section of `install.user.ini`. Remove the value from the
        ``user`` line.
        
        =================
         User management
        =================
        
        Roles
        =====
        
        Access to the address book is only granted after authentication. There
        are three roles to authorize a user:
        
        - visitor: visit all person's data, search and export, change own
          password
        
        - editor: permissions of visitor + edit all person's data, change own
          log-in name
        
        - administrator: permissions of editor + create and change address
          book and users
        
        Create new users
        ================
        
        Users are persons from the address book augmented by log-in
        information.
        
        To create the first new user inside an address book the adminstrator
        (who was created in `First installation`_) has to log-in and then do
        the following:
        
          1. create a new person with an e-mail address using `Add person`.
        
          2. create a new user using `Master data --> Users --> Add user`.
        
        The newly created user has now a log-in (e-mail address) for the
        address book the person belonges to.
        
        =======
         To do
        =======
        
        Next major version
        ==================
        
        - Probably: Full text search.
        
        Longer term
        ===========
        
        The following features might be implemented over the next months:
        
        - person data
        
          * store picture per person
        
        - company as entity
        
        - import
        
          * vCard
        
          * SQLite (Apple's Addressbook.app)
        
        - export
        
          * custom XLS export
        
          * LDAP export
        
        - more search abilities
        
          * full text search
        
          * combined search
        
          * wildcard search
