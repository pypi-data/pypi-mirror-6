        This extension provides you with the possibility to define advanced
        virtual hosting strategies within `Silva`_.
        
        To use this extension, you must add it to your `Silva`_ site, and
        activate it in ``service_extension``. After, you will have a Silva
        service available in ZMI, ``service_forest`` where you can define
        virtual host, and rewrite rules inside each one.
        
        To enable the extension you must click on activate in the
        ``service_forest``.
        
        To trigger a virtual host, you must set the HTTP header ``X-VHM-Url``
        inside your HTTP request to Silva.
        
        This is done like this in Apache, for instance::
        
          <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerName demo30.silvacms.org
        
            RequestHeader set X-VHM-URL http://demo30.silvacms.org
            RewriteEngine On
            RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ http://localhost:7778/$1 [P]
         </VirtualHost>
