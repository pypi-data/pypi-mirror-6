Description: # django-sslify
        
        Do you want to force HTTPs across your Django site? You're in the right place!
        
        
        ![Use SSL for all the things!](https://github.com/rdegges/django-sslify/raw/master/assets/ssl_all_the_things.jpg)
        
        
        ## Install
        
        To install ``django-sslify``, simply run ``pip install django-sslify`` and
        you'll get the latest version installed automatically.
        
        If you're using Heroku, you should add: `django-sslify>=0.2` to your
        `requirements.txt` file in the root of your project directory.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Modify your Django ``settings.py`` file, and prepend
        ``sslify.middleware.SSLifyMiddleware`` to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` setting:
        
        ``` python
        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
            'sslify.middleware.SSLifyMiddleware',
            # ...
        )
        ```
        
        **NOTE**: Make sure ``sslify.middleware.SSLifyMiddleware`` is the first
        middleware class listed, as this will ensure that if a user makes an unsecure
        request (over HTTP), they will be redirected to HTTPs before any actual
        processing happens.
        
        
        ## Notes
        
        This code was taken from [this StackOverflow
        thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8436666/how-to-make-python-on-heroku-https-only).
        
        I've only tested this on Heroku, so if it doesn't work for you, please send a
        pull request and I'll merge.
        
        If you're using Heroku, and have no idea how to setup SSL, read [this great
        article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint) which talks about
        using the new SSL endpoint addon (which fucking rocks!).
