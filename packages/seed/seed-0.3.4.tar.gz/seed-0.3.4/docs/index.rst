.. Seed documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Seed's documentation!
===========================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   

Seed is an experiment in making releasing PyPi packages trivially 
easy. For example, the ``release`` command will:

* Increment the version number in ``__init__.py``
* Update CHANGES.txt with commit summaries & authors
* Tag the release
* Commit the above changes
* Register/upload your package to PyPi

I am not sure if a need for this exists, but my hope is that it will 
lower the time & effort needed to create and release Python packages.

Installation
============

Installing Seed is easy using pip::

    pip install seed

PyPi registration
-----------------

To start releasing packages you are also going to need to 
`register with PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form>`_. Now place 
your login details into ``~/.pypirc`` as follows::

    [server-login]
    username:yourusername
    password:yourpassword

.. note::

    Storing your password in plaintext is clearly not ideal. If anyone knows of a workaround 
    I would love to hear it.

Getting started
===============

If you need an entirely fresh package then you can do this::

    seed create --dry-run  # Do a dry run to make sure everything looks right
    seed create

You can also pass a few options to the ``create`` command. See the help for details::

    seed help create


If you already have a package you can release it using::

    seed release --dry-run  # Do a dry run to make sure everything looks right
    seed release

Again, options are documented here::

    seed help release

**Notes on releasing:** The release process makes a bunch of assumptions 
about your project. If you created your project using the ``create`` command, 
then you are probably fine, but you may need to do a little hacking otherwise.

Other notes & about the author
==============================

The structure of Seed is heavily based on that of `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip/>`_. 
It is still a bit rough around the edges, but the basic stuff is there.

I find myself managing a lot of packages as I always have a number of Django projects on the go 
and sharing reusable code is always a plus. I also use Heroku a lot, but Heroku doesn't play 
nicely when installing dependencies via external URLs, hence my desire to release more packages 
to PyPi rather than just installing them right out of GutHub.
