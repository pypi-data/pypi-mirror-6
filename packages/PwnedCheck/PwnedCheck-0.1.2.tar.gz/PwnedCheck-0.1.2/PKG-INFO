        Usage
        =====
        
        All checks are done through the `check` method. This will check a single email address against the haveibeenpwned API
        and return a list of sites that the email address has been found on.
        
        If the email address is not found in any of the data leaks, it will return an empty list (`[]`).
        
        If the email address is invalid (not properlly formatted), `PwnedCheck` will throw an `InvalidEmail` exception.
        
        
            import pwnedcheck
        
            print pwnedcheck.check("foo@bar.com")
