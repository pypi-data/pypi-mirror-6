Description: lib2d is a 2D drawing and animation library for games. Both the C and Python
        API are given equal love and is suitable for games made with either language.
        
        lib2d is not a standalone game engine. An OpenGL context will need to be
        created before instantiating a lib2d scene. SDL2 is used by the example
        programs, but lib2d's only dependency is OpenGL.
        
        
        Rabbyt's spiritual successor
        ----------------------------
        
        lib2d doesn't attempt to mimic Rabbyt's API or feature set. Instead, lib2d
        tries to learn from Rabbyt's mistakes while retaining the same goals and ideas.
        lib2d is as close to a Rabbyt 2.0 as you'll get.
        
        Some things lib2d does different from Rabbyt:
        
        * Python 3 support.
        * Better performance.
        * OpenGL ES 2.0
        * Simplified API.
        * C implementation and API, using ctypes to create a pythonic API.
