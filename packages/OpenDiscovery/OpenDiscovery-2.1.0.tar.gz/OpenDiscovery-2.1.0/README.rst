Introduction
------------

Open Discovery is a suite of programs that use Open Source or freely
available tools to dock a library of chemical compounds against a
receptor protein. In a (currently submitted) paper in the Journal of
Chemical Education, we outline the usefulness of having an
uncomplicated, free-to-use protocol to accomplish a task that has been
the subject of academic and commercial interest for decades. We also
highlight the gaps in open source tools around preparing protein -
ligand complexes for molecular simulation, an area we expect to develop
in the future.

Dependencies
------------

-  Python (you probably have this, install from
   http://www.python.org/getit/ - version developed with: 2.7)
-  Open Babel (install from http://openbabel.org/ - version developed
   with: 2.3.1)
-  AutoDock Vina binary (provided in lib folder, but downloaded from
   http://vina.scripps.edu - version developed with: 1.1.2)

Terminology
-----------

-  Protocol Folder = the folder containing this readme and odscreen.py
-  Ligand Folder = the folder with the config file, the folder with the
   ligands and the folder with the receptors in (PDB and PDBQT).

Walkthrough
-----------

A simple walkthrough for this new version will be created shortly.
