        Advanced search and discovery tool
        ==================================
        
        This tool was built to allow you to query the worlds largest database. The
        query strings will be rendered in your local web browser as standard HTML
        content. If this tool is running on a headless system the tool willl provide
        you a link to the content that you are looking for.
        
        
        Why
        ---
        
        Sometimes you just need information and sometimes you want this information at
        your fingertips without the bottleneck of a mouse.
        
        If these things have ever been true for you this tool is for you.
