Description: Craig's Generator
        ======
        Read listings Pythonically.
        
        Examples
        ---------
        Generate listings. ::
        
            from craigsgenerator import Section
            for listing in Section('austin','sub'):
                print(listing)
        
        Additional arguments get passed to ``requests.get``. ::
        
            from craigsgenerator import Section
            proxies = {'https':'example.com'}
            for listing in Section('austin','sub', proxies = proxies):
                print(listing)
        
        Downloaded files are cached by default and refreshed
        if they're older than a day. Change the directory by
        specifying the ``cachedir``. ::
        
            from craigsgenerator import Section
            for listing in Section('austin','sub', cachedir = 'downloads'):
                print(listing)
        
        Disable caching by setting the ``cachedir`` to ``None``. ::
        
            from craigsgenerator import Section
            for listing in Section('austin','sub', cachedir = None):
                print(listing)
        
        Get the full text of the listing with the ``fulltext`` function. ::
        
            from craigsgenerator import Section
            for listing in Section('austin','sub'):
                print(listing)
                print(fulltext(listing))
