        What is ztfy.thesaurus ?
        ========================
        
        ztfy.thesaurus is a quite small package used to handle content's indexation
        through the help of a structured and controlled vocabulary's thesaurus, which is
        like a big hierarchic dictionary of terms linked together.
        
        Several XML standards have emerged to handle such thesauri ; this package is mainly based
        on a custom format but can import and export data in formats like SKOS (RDF) and SuperDoc.
