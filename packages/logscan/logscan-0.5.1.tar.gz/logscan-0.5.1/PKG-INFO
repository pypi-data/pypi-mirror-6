Description: logscan
        =========
        
        logscan is a command-line-tool to get time-specific access to logfiles.
        It can handle rotated and gzipped logfiles or reads from stdin. The log
        is automatically checked for different timecodes.

              logscan is able to handle rotated and/or gzipped logfiles or to read stdin.
              It supports several formats for time-information in the log, and checks the
              logfiles automatically for them. You can also specify further formats in
              logscan.conf.
        
        
            positional argument:
              LOGFILE                   If LOGFILE is missing or '-' stdin is read instead.
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help                print this help message and exit
              -i, --info                print the number of files, the start-time and end-time
              -c, --timecode TIMECODE   use TIMECODE to parse the log-times (e.g. "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
              -g, --grep PATTERN        print only lines where PATTERN was found
              -d, --date DATE           print all log-entries of DATE
        
            arguments for times:
              -d, --date DATE           print all log-entries of DATE
              -t, --time [DATE] TIME    specify a point of time; use it twice to specify
                                        a start- and end-time
        
            argruments for durations:
              -p, --plus [WEEKS] [DAYS] [HOURS] [MINUTES] [SECONDS]
              -m, --minus [WEEKS] [DAYS] [HOURS] [MINUTES] [SECONDS]
        
        
            times (DATE and TIME):
              DATE and TIME could be in any format. Logscan tries hard to interpret the input
              as valid date or time.
              If DATE is omitted for --time logscan uses the date of the last log-entry.
              If DATE is incomplete logscan completes it with the year or the year and month
              of the actual date.
        
        
            durations:
              To specify a positive duration use --plus, for a negative use --minus.
              All values are interpreted as weeks, days, hours, minutes or seconds -in this
              order starting with days. Alternatively you can flag the values with letters
              matching those keywords.
              So to specify a positive duration of 3 days and 4 minutes you can either do
              "--plus 3 0 4" or --plus 3d 4m.
        
        
            Which period to print is defined as follows:
              no times and no duration:         from start to eof
              one time and no duration:         from time to eof
              two times and no duration:        from time-one to time-two
              no times and positive duration:   form start to end of duration
              no times and negative duration:   from begin of duration to eof
              one time and positive duration:   from time to end of duration
              one time and negative duration:   from begin of duration to time
        
        
            time-code-formats:
              logscan checks a log-file automatically for these formats:
              %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
              %b %d %X %Y
              %b %d %X
              Also a timestamp as total amount of seconds since epoche (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)
              is supported. logscan expects for it a ten-digit decimal with three decimal-places.
              To specify further format-codes use logscan.conf. logscan uses either the first
              format that fits or an explicitly with --timecode given format.
              A list of all available format-codes can be recieved from 'date --help'.
