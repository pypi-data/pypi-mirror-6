Description: DEPLOYER
        ========
        
        ### This webdeployer allows you to deploy fast and easy to your webserver.
        Automate deployments of your webapps using :
        
        -   GUNICORN
        -   NGINX
        -   SUPERVISORD
        
        You need to use a directory format like : ```/projects/client/client_name/project/source```
        
        requirements :
        - Python 2.7
        - Fabric
        - Jinja2
        
        
        On your server you need to have already installed and running:
        -   nginx
        -   gunicorn(not realy only you need to have the package installed)
        -   supervisord
        
        
        This is being set free from Private so it may take time to free out all the mess from my private repo
        
        
        TO INSTALL
        ==========
        
        ```
