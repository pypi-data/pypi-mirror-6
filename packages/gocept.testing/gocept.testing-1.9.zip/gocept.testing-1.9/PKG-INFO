Description: ==============
        gocept.testing
        ==============
        
        This package collects various helpers for writing tests.
        
        .. contents:: :depth: 1
        
        
        assertEllipsis
        ==============
        
        An assertion which is very helpful when using Testbrowser with
        unittest.TestCase (instead of doctests).
        
        Some examples::
        
            class MyTest(unittest.TestCase, gocept.testing.assertion.Ellipsis):
            # [...]
        
        
            self.assertEllipsis('...bar...', 'foo bar qux')
            # -> nothing happens
        
            self.assertEllipsis('foo', 'bar')
            # -> AssertionError: Differences (ndiff with -expected +actual):
                 - foo
                 + bar
        
            self.assertNotEllipsis('foo', 'foo')
            # -> AssertionError: "Value unexpectedly matches expression 'foo'."
        
        To use, inherit from ``gocept.testing.assertion.Ellipsis`` in addition to
        ``unittest.TestCase``.
        
        
        assertStartsWith, assertEndsWith
        ================================
        
        ::
        
            class MyTest(unittest.TestCase, gocept.testing.assertion.String):
        
                def test_something(self):
                    self.assertStartsWith('foo', 'foobar') # --> pass
                    self.assertEndsWith('bar', 'foobar') # --> pass
                    self.assertStartsWith('qux', 'foobar') # --> fail
                    self.assertEndsWith('qux', 'foobar') # --> fail
        
        
        assertNothingRaised
        ===================
        
        The opposite of assertRaises(), this is an assertion that makes some tests more
        readable. As assertRaises(), it can be used as as context manager, too::
        
            class MyTest(unittest.TestCase, gocept.testing.assertion.Exceptions):
            # [...]
        
            self.assertNothingRaised(do_something, 1, 2, 3)
        
            with self.assertNothingRaised():
                do_something(1, 2, 3)
        
        
        mock patch context
        ==================
        
        ``gocept.testing.mock.Patches`` collects `mock`_ patches that are valid for the
        whole TestCase, and resets them all in one go in tearDown (this is pending
        incluion upstream as ``mock.patcher()``, see `issue 30`_)::
        
            class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
        
                def setUp(self):
                    self.patches = gocept.testing.mock.Patches()
        
                def tearDown(self):
                    self.patches.reset()
        
                def test_something(self):
                    compile = self.patches.add('re.compile')
        
        It offers three methods:
        
        :add: wraps ``mock.patch()``
        :add_object: wraps ``mock.patch.object``
        :add_dict: wraps ``mock.patch.dict``
        
        Note that ``gocept.testing`` does not declare a dependency on ``mock`` to be as
        lightweight as possible, so clients need to do that themselves.
        
        If you want to save typing, you can mix ``gocept.testing.mock.PatchHelper``
        into your TestCase, it defines a setUp method that instatiates ``Patches`` and
        a tearDown that calls ``reset()`` on it.
        
        
        .. _`mock`: http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/
        .. _`issue 30`: http://code.google.com/p/mock/issues/detail?id=30
        
        
        assertCalledWith
        ================
        
        This is syntactic sugar around ``mock.assert_called_with``, so you can write::
        
            class MyTest(unittest.TestCase, gocept.testing.mock.Assertions):
        
                def test_something(self):
                    dummy = mock.Mock()
                    dummy(True)
                    self.assertCalledWith(dummy, True)
        
        instead of::
        
            dummy.assert_called_with(True)
        
        
        Mocking properties
        ==================
        
        ``gocept.testing.mock.Property`` is syntactic sugar directly lifted from the
        `mock documentation`_ that allows you to patch properties like this::
        
            class Dummy(object):
        
                @property
                def foo(self):
                    return False
        
        
            with mock.patch('Dummy.foo', gocept.testing.mock.Property()) as foo:
                foo.return_value = 'something else'
        
        
        .. _`mock documentation`: http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/examples.html
        
        
        Attribute patch context
        =======================
        
        This has nothing to do with mocks, it's a convenience helper for setting and
        automatically resetting attributes of objects::
        
            class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
        
                def setUp(self):
                    self.patches = gocept.testing.patch.Patches()
                    self.subject = MyClass()
        
                def tearDown(self):
                    self.patches.reset()
        
                def test_something(self):
                    self.assertEqual('one', self.subject.foo)
                    self.patches.set(self.subject, 'foo', 'two')
                    self.assertEqual('two', self.subject.foo)
        
        
        Method call patch context
        =========================
        
        This allows to call a method and reset it later on automatically. At the
        moment, only methods that take a single parameter are supported, by passing in
        both the old value (to which it should be reset) and the new value::
        
            class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
        
                def setUp(self):
                    self.patches = gocept.testing.patch.Patches()
        
                def tearDown(self):
                    self.patches.reset()
        
                def test_something(self):
                    self.patches.call(
                        zope.component.hooks, 'setSite',
                        zope.component.hooks.getSite(), new_site)
        
        
        Dict patching context manager
        =============================
        
        ``gocept.testing.patch.Dict`` is a context manager allowing to change values
        in a dict. It restores the original dict at exit. E. g. it can be used to
        temporarily change values in ``os.environ``::
        
            >>> with gocept.testing.patch.Dict(os.environ, foo='bar', qwe='asdf'):
                    print os.environ.get('foo')
            bar
            >>> print os.environ.get('foo')
            None
        
        
        Temporary directory
        ===================
        
        ``gocept.testing.fixture.TempDir`` encapsulates the common pattern to create a
        temporary directory and delete it after the test has run. The name of the
        directory is avaliable as ``self.tmpdir``. Note that since
        ``unittest.TestCase`` does not call `super`, you need to mix in ``TempDir``
        first::
        
            class MyTest(gocept.testing.fixture.TempDir, unittest.TestCase):
        
                def test_something(self):
                    self.assertTrue(os.path.isdir(self.tmpdir))
        
        
        Comparing mtimes
        ================
        
        ``gocept.testing.mtime.Newer`` checks that generated files are at least as new
        as their source counterparts (similar like ``make`` works)::
        
            class MyTest(gocept.testing.mtime.Newer, unittest.TestCase):
        
                source_ext = '.js'
                target_ext = '.min.js'
                message = 'run jsmin to correct this'
        
                def test_minified_js_files_are_younger_than_non_minified_ones(self):
                    self.check_files(pkg_resources.resource_filename(
                        'my.package', 'resources/js'))
        
        
        Retrying flaky tests
        ====================
        
        ``gocept.testing.retry`` is a decorator that calls a function several times
        (default: 3) if the function raises an exception, it is swallowed, except on
        the last repetition. This is useful for running flaky tests several times, but
        only fail when they actually fail *each* time, not only some of the time::
        
            class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
        
                @gocept.testing.retry(5)
                def test_fails_sometimes():
                    # ...
        
        Note that this does not play well with ``py.test``, since ``retry`` changes the
        function's signature to ``(*args, **kw)``, so the funcargs-based fixtures of
        ``py.test`` won't work (and unfortunately, using `decorator`_ to alleviate that
        is not an option due to too much funcargs magic in ``py.test``).
        
        .. _`decorator`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator
