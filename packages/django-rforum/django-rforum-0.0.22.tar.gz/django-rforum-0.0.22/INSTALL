Django-rforum - Installation instructions
=========================================

Creating an enviroment for your project
---------------------------------------
	
You have to create an environment where everything will be installed.
Create first the directory where the environment will be created and
enter in the enviroment:

::
	$ mkdir myproject
	$ cd myproject
	$ virtualenv --distribute env
	$ source env/bin/activate
		

Creating a new django project
-----------------------------

Once you're into the enviroment, next step involves creating a new
django project. So, being inside the virtual environment, we must
install django (required dependency, of course) and then, create the project:
	
::

	$ pip install django


Installing Django-rforum
-------------------------

Now we have a real project, we're ready to import Django-rforum, so
we can handle it managing the following pip command:

::
		
    $ pip install django-rforum

Configuring project
-------------------

We have to configure a new project. The package is provided with a
sample Django app (rforum-example), so we can use it (if you want to start from
scratch). Otherwise you have to "merge" the urls.py and settings.py files:

::

	$ cp -r env/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rforum/rforum-example/ src/
	$ cd src/
	$ python manage.py syncdb
	$ nano project/settings.py (uncomment rforum and allauth.socialacount.* installed apps)
	$ python manage.py syncdb
	$ python manage.py migrate
	$ nano project/settings.py (comment allauth.socialacount.* installed apps)
	$ python manage.py loaddata ../env/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rforum/fixtures/import.json
	$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

::
	http://localhost:8000/rforum/
	http://localhost:8000/admin/rforum/


Templates
---------

If you want to override the templates you only have to copy them from
sample Django app (rforum-example) to your project and change all what
you need.
