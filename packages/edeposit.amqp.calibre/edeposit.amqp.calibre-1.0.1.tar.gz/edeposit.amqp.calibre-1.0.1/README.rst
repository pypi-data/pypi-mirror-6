Introduction
============

This module provides wrapper for Calibre, to access itâ€™s conversion functions using AMQP protocol.

Module provides only generic wrapper, not AMQP communication itself - that is handled by Calibredaemon from edeposit.amqp project.

`Full module documentation <http://edeposit-amqp-calibre.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ is hosted at the ReadTheDocs.

Acceptance tests
----------------

`Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org/>`__ is used to test the sources, which are stored in ``src/edeposit/amqp/aleph/tests`` directory.

You can run them manually (from the root of the package):

Or continuously using nosier:

::

    $ nosier -p src -b 'export' "pybot -W 80 --pythonpath src/edeposit/amqp/calibre/tests/ --pythonpath src src/edeposit/amqp/calibre/tests/"
