README for Insert Search Field Code Source
==========================================

This README should reside inside a Silva Code Source named 'cs_searchfield'. 
The Code Source allows Authors to insert a search field in a document.

When inserting the Search Field, if 'show button' is turned on visitors will 
see a submit button. This is optional because the form will also submit when 
hitting the enter or return key.

Customizing the Search Field CS
-------------------------------
The code in the page template named 'layut' can be easily adjusted to your 
personal requirements. 

Parameters
----------
You can adjust the fields in the parameters form. Change the search field 
size, add a break, etc.

CSS style
---------
The field is wrapped in a div with class="searchfield" for positioning, 
alignment, sizing, and so forth.
