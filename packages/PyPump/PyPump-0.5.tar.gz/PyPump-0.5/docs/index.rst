PyPump - Python Pump.io Library
===============================

PyPump is a simple but powerful and pythonic way of interfacing with the `pump.io <http://pump.io>`_ API.

PyPump is under the `GPLv3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_. You should probably
look to see if/how this may impact you and your programs if you wish to use PyPump. The community
for PyPump lives on IRC in the #pypump channel on `MegNet <http://megworld.co.uk/irc>`_.

---------------
If you're new to PyPump and feeling a bit overwhelmed the :doc:`gettingstarted/tutorial` is the best
