 * @mainpage
 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * The libtfrspec library computes multi-tapered conventional and
 * time-frequency reassignment spectrograms from real-valued time
 * series. Time-frequency reassignment is a technique for sharpening
 * spectrographic representations of complex time-varying
 * processes. See README for more details on the algorithms used.
 *
 * Transforms are started by initializing an @ref mfft structure with
 * the size of the transform and the tapering functions to be
 * used. Transforms using DPSS and Hermite tapers can be initialized
 * with specialized functions:
 * - mtm_init_dpss()
 * - mtm_init_herm()
 *
 * After initializing the transform object, it can be used to perform
 * any number of operations.  In general, the transformed signal is
 * stored in the @ref mfft object and must be extracted.  See the
 * following functions for calculating real or complex spectra:
 * - mtfft()
 * - mtpower()
 * - mtcomplex()
 *
 * Spectrograms are generally calculated by sliding an analysis window
 * along the signal and using it to calculate the spectral density in
 * that window. This is the short-time fourier transform.  The
 * time-frequency reassigned spectrogram improves on this by allowing
 * energy to be reassigned across frames, but the general principle is
 * the same.  The spectrogram functions are fairly straightforward but
 * they do require preallocation of the output array.
 * - mtm_spec()  for standard STFT with one or more tapers
 * - mtm_zspec() for complex STFT with one or more tapers
 * - tfr_spec()  for reassigned spectrogram
 *
 * Other functions in the library are used internally to generate
 * Hermite and DPSS tapers and to do the time-frequency reassignment.
 * They are included in the public interface, though ordinary use
 * should have no need of them.
