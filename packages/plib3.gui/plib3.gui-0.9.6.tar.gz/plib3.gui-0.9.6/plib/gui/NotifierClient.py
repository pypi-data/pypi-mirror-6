This module contains the NotifierClient class. This is
a mixin class designed to allow an async socket I/O class
to multiplex its event loop with a GUI event loop. Due to
limitations in some GUI toolkits, this functionality is
implemented in two different ways, depending on the toolkit
in use:

- For Qt 4, PySide, and KDE 4, the PSocketNotifier class is present,
  and its functionality is used to allow the GUI event loop to
  respond to socket events. This is the desired approach.

- For wxWidgets, there is no straightforward way to
  make the GUI event loop "see" socket events; there are possible
  approaches involving threading, but these are complex and prone
  to brittleness. Instead, the kludgy but workable approach is
  taken of making the asnyc socket I/O ``select`` loop the "primary"
  one, and using the GUI application's ``process_events`` method
  to pump its events based on a ``select`` timeout.

        Note that the notifier client object must be instantiated
        *before* the application's event loop is started, or no
        socket events will be processed. (Possible places to do that are
        constructors for any client widget classes, or the app itself
        if you are defining your own app class; or in any methods that
        are called from those constructors, such as the ``_create_panels``
        method of a main panel.)
        
        Note also that we override the ``do_loop`` method to yield control
        back to the GUI event loop, and the ``check_done`` method to
        un-yield so the function that called ``do_loop`` (normally the
        ``client_communicate`` method) can return as it normally would.
        This allows user code to be written portably, so that it does not
        even need to know which event loop is actually running.
