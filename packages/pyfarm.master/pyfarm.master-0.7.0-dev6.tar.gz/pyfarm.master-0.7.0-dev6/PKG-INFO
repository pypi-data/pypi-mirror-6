        Sub-library which contains the code necessary to run an instance of the master
        server.  Each master instance is intended to be able to serve:
            * the underlying REST api for PyFarm
            * backend for the admin interface
            * layer between requests and resources such as:
                * agents
                * queue management
                * jobs and tasks
                * progress information
                * general metrics
