        Django Post Office
        ==================
        
        Django Post Office is a simple app to send and manage your emails in Django.
        Some awesome features are:
        
        * Allows you to send email asynchronously
        * Supports HTML email
        * Supports database based email templates
        * Built in scheduling support 
        * Works well with task queues like `RQ <http://python-rq.org>`_ or `Celery <http://www.celeryproject.org>`_
        * Uses multiprocessing to send a large number of emails in parallel
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        * `django >= 1.2 <http://djangoproject.com/>`_
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/ui/django-post_office.png?branch=master
        
        
        * Install from PyPI (or you `manually download from PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-post_office>`_)::
        
            pip install django-post_office
        
        * Add ``post_office`` to your INSTALLED_APPS in django's ``settings.py``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                # other apps
                "post_office",
            )
        
        * Run ``syncdb``::
        
            python manage.py syncdb
        
        * Set ``post_office.EmailBackend`` as your ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` in django's ``settings.py``::
        
            EMAIL_BACKEND = 'post_office.EmailBackend'
        
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        To get started, make sure you have Django's admin interface enabled. Create an
        ``EmailTemplate`` instance via ``/admin`` and you can start sending emails.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from post_office import mail
        
            mail.send(
                ['recipient1@example.com'],
                'from@example.com',
                template='welcome_email', # Could be an EmailTemplate instance or name
                context={'foo': 'bar'},
            )
        
        The above command will put your email on the queue so you can use the
        command in your webapp without slowing down the request/response cycle too much.
        To actually send them out, run ``python manage.py send_queued_mail``.
        You can schedule this management command to run regularly via cron::
        
            * * * * * (/usr/bin/python manage.py send_queued_mail >> send_mail.log 2>&1)
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        mail.send()
        -----------
        
        ``mail.send`` is the most important function in this library, it takes these
        arguments:
        
        =============== ======== =========================
        Argument        Required Description
        =============== ======== =========================
        recipients      Yes      list of recipient email addresses
        sender          No       Defaults to ``settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL``, display name is allowed (``John <john@example.com>``)
        template        No       ``EmailTemplate`` instance or name
        context         No       A dictionary used when email is being rendered
        subject         No       Email subject (if ``template`` is not specified)
        message         No       Email content (if ``template`` is not specified)
        html_message    No       Email's HTML content (if ``template`` is not specified)
        headers         No       A dictionary of extra headers to put on the message
        scheduled_time  No       A date/datetime object indicating when the email should be sent
        priority        No       ``high``, ``medium``, ``low`` or ``now`` (send immediately)
        attachments     No       Email attachments - A dictionary where the keys are the wanted filenames,
                                 and the values are either files or file-like objects, or full path of
                                 the file.
        =============== ======== =========================
        
        Here are a few examples.
        
        If you just want to send out emails without using database templates. You can
        call the ``send`` command without the ``template`` argument.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from post_office import mail
        
            mail.send(
                ['recipient1@example.com'],
                'from@example.com',
                subject='Welcome!',
                message='Welcome home, {{ name }}!',
                html_message='Welcome home, <b>{{ name }}</b>!',
                headers={'Reply-to': 'reply@example.com'},
                scheduled_time=date(2014, 1, 1),
                context={'name': 'Alice'},
            )
        
        ``post_office`` is also task queue friendly. Passing ``now`` as priority into
        ``send_mail`` will deliver the email right away (instead of queuing it),
        regardless of how many emails you have in your queue:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from post_office import mail
        
            mail.send(
                ['recipient1@example.com'],
                'from@example.com',
                template='welcome_email',
                context={'foo': 'bar'},
                priority='now',
            )
        
        This is useful if you already use something like `django-rq <https://github.com/ui/django-rq>`_
        to send emails asynchronously and only need to store email related activities and logs.
        
        Sending an email with attachments:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from django.core.files.base import ContentFile
            from post_office import mail
        
            mail.send(
                ['recipient1@example.com'],
                'from@example.com',
                template='welcome_email',
                context={'foo': 'bar'},
                priority='now',
                attachments={
                    'attachment1.doc', '/path/to/file/file1.doc',
                    'attachment2.txt', ContentFile('file content'),
                }
            )
        
        Template Tags and Variables
        ---------------------------
        
        ``post-office`` supports Django's template tags and variables when.
        For example, if you put "Hello, {{ name }}" in the subject line and pass in
        ``{'name': 'Alice'}`` as context, you will get "Hello, Alice" as subject:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from post_office.models import EmailTemplate
            from post_office import mail
        
            EmailTemplate.objects.create(
                name='morning_greeting',
                subject='Morning, {{ name|capfirst }}',
                content='Hi {{ name }}, how are you feeling today?',
                html_content='Hi <strong>{{ name }}</strong>, how are you feeling today?',
            )
        
            mail.send(
                ['recipient@example.com'],
                'from@example.com',
                template='morning_greeting',
                context={'name': 'alice'},
            )
        
            # This will create an email with the following content:
            subject = 'Morning, Alice',
            content = 'Hi alice, how are you feeling today?'
            content = 'Hi <strong>alice</strong>, how are you feeling today?'
        
        
        Custom Email Backends
        ---------------------
        
        By default, ``post_office`` uses django's SMTP ``EmailBackend``. If you want to
        use a different backend, you can do so by changing ``POST_OFFICE_BACKEND``.
        
        For example if you want to use `django-ses <https://github.com/hmarr/django-ses>`_::
        
            POST_OFFICE_BACKEND = 'django_ses.SESBackend'
        
        
        Caching
        -------
        
        By default, ``post_office`` will cache ``EmailTemplate`` instances if Django's caching
        mechanism is configured. If for some reason you want to disable caching, you can
        set ``POST_OFFICE_CACHE`` to ``False`` in ``settings.py``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            ## All cache key will be prefixed by post_office:template:
            ## To turn OFF caching, you need to explicitly set POST_OFFICE_CACHE to False in settings
            POST_OFFICE_CACHE = False
        
            ## Optional: to use a non default cache backend, add a "post_office" entry in CACHES
            CACHES = {
                'post_office': {
                    'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyLibMCCache',
                    'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
                }
            }
        
        
        send_many()
        -----------
        
        Starting from version 0.6.0, ``post-office`` includes ``mail.send_many()``
        that's much more performant (generates less database queries) when
        sending a large number of emails. Since this function uses Django's
        `bulk_create <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/models/querysets/#bulk-create>`_ command, it's only usable on Django >= 1.4.
        
        Behavior wise, ``mail.send_many()`` is almost identical to ``mail.send()``,
        with the exception that it accepts a list of keyword arguments that you'd
        usually pass into ``mail.send()``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from post_office import mail
            
            first_email = {
                'sender': 'from@example.com',
                'recipients': ['alice@example.com'],
                'subject': 'Hi!',
                'message': 'Hi Alice!'
            }
            second_email = {
                'sender': 'from@example.com',
                'recipients': ['bob@example.com'],
                'subject': 'Hi!',
                'message': 'Hi Bob!'
            }
            kwargs_list = [first_email, second_email]
        
            mail.send_many(kwargs_list)
        
        Attachments are not supported with ``mail.send_many()``.
            
        
        Management Commands
        -------------------
        
        * ``send_queued_mail`` - send queued emails, those aren't successfully sent
          will be marked as ``failed``. If you have a lot of emails, you can
          pass in ``-`p` or ``--processes`` flag to use multiple processes.
        
        * ``cleanup_mail`` - delete all emails created before an X number of days
          (defaults to 90).
        
        You may want to set these up via cron to run regularly::
        
            * * * * * (cd $PROJECT; python manage.py send_queued_mail --processes=1 >> $PROJECT/cron_mail.log 2>&1)
            0 1 * * * (cd $PROJECT; python manage.py cleanup_mail --days=30 >> $PROJECT/cron_mail_cleanup.log 2>&1)
        
        
        Logging
        -------
        
        You can configure ``post-office``'s logging from Django's ``settings.py``. For
        example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
            
            LOGGING = {
                "version": 1,
                "disable_existing_loggers": False,
                "formatters": {
                    "post_office": {
                        "format": "[%(levelname)s]%(asctime)s PID %(process)d: %(message)s",
                        "datefmt": "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S",
                    },
                },
                "handlers": {
                    "post_office": {
                        "level": "DEBUG",
                        "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
                        "formatter": "post_office"
                    },
                    # If you use sentry for logging
                    'sentry': {
                        'level': 'ERROR',
                        'class': 'raven.contrib.django.handlers.SentryHandler',
                    },
                },
                'loggers': {
                "post_office": {
                    "handlers": ["post_office", "sentry"],
                    "level": "INFO"
                },
            }
        
        Batch Size
        ----------
        
        If you may want to limit the number of emails sent in a batch (sometimes useful
        in a low memory environment), use the ``BATCH_SIZE`` argument to limit the
        number of queued emails fetched in one batch. 
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            POST_OFFICE = {
                'BATCH_SIZE': 5000
            }
        
        
        Running Tests
        =============
        
        To run ``post_office``'s test suite::
        
            `which django-admin.py` test post_office --settings=post_office.test_settings --pythonpath=.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========

        Version 0.6.0
        -------------
        * Support for Python 3!
        * Added mail.send_many() that's much more performant when sending
          a large number emails
        
        Version 0.5.2
        -------------
        * Added logging
