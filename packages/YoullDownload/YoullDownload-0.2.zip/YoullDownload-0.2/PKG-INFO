        ==========
        
        Let say you need to use the HTTP load testing and benchmarking utility `siege`__ on a web page
        and you also want to use the ``--internet`` option, to simulate at best the behavior of a web browser.
        
        __ http://www.joedog.org/siege-home/
        
        When a web browser load a page, it also load all the resources inside that page:
        
        * Images
        * JavaScript files
        * CSS
        
        So you need a list of all URLs taken from that page.
        
        This utility (its name mean "**You Will Download**") will simply create this list for you.
        
        You simply need to redirect the utility output to a file, then use also the siege ``--file`` option.
