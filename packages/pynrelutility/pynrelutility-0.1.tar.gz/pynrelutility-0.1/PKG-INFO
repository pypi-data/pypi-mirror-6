        README
        ------
        This is a Python wrapper for NREL's utility API. 
        
        It allows you to directly convert an address into
        utility information (utility name, residential, 
        commercial and industrial electricity costs).

        Dependencies
        ------------
        It has dependency on the json package, included with Python versions 2.7 and later.
        requests library is also needed and will be installed by setuptools.
        
        It is developed on Python 2.7 but should work on earlier versions. 
        Not tested if it is also compatible with Python 3. Sorry.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        You can install this package using pip:
