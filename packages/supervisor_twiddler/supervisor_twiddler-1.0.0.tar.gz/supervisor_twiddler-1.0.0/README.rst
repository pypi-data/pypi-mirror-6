supervisor_twiddler
===================

This package is an RPC extension for `Supervisor <http://supervisord.org>`_
that allows Supervisor's configuration and state to be manipulated in ways
that are not normally possible at runtime.

Installation
------------

supervisor_twiddler packages are
`available on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/supervisor_twiddler>`_.
You download them from there or you can use ``pip`` to
automatically install or upgrade:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U supervisor_twiddler

After installing the package, add these lines to your ``supervisord.conf`` file
to register the twiddler interface:

.. code-block:: ini

    [rpcinterface:twiddler]
    supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor_twiddler.rpcinterface:make_twiddler_rpcinterface

You must restart Supervisor for the twiddler interface to be loaded.

Usage
-----

There are times when it is useful to be able to dynamically add and remove
process configurations on a supervisord instance. This is the functionality
that supervisor_twiddler provides. After restarting supervisord, the changes
made by supervisor_twiddler will not persist.

The following Python interpreter session demonstrates the usage.

First, a `ServerProxy` object must be configured. If supervisord is listening on
an inet socket, `ServerProxy` configuration is simple:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import xmlrpclib
    >>> s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('http://localhost:9001')

If supervisord is listening on a domain socket, `ServerProxy` can be configured
with `SupervisorTransport`. The URL must still be supplied and be a valid HTTP
URL to appease ServerProxy, but it is superfluous.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import xmlrpclib
    >>> from supervisor.xmlrpc import SupervisorTransport
    >>> s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('http://127.0.0.1/whatever',
    ... SupervisorTransport('', '', 'unix:///path/to/supervisor.sock'))

Once `ServerProxy` has been configured appropriately, we can now exercise
supervisor_twiddler:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s.twiddler.getAPIVersion()
    '0.1'
    >>> s.twiddler.addProgramToGroup('group_name', 'ls', {'command':'ls -l',
    ... 'autostart':'false', 'autorestart':'false', 'startsecs':'0'})
    True
    >>> s.supervisor.startProcess('group_name:ls')
    True
    >>> s.supervisor.readProcessLog('group_name:ls', 0, 50)
    'total 0
    drwxr-xr-x   9 mnaberez  mnaberez  306 Nov'

In the session above, a new program called `ls` was added to the existing
group called `group_name`.  You can create empty groups in `supervisord.conf`
by adding an empty `[group:x]` section.

The process was configured to not start automatically (`autostart`), not restart
automatically (`autorestart`), and `startsecs` was set to zero so Supervisor would
not think its quick termination was an error.

The process was then started and its output read using the normal API commands
provided by Supervisor.

API Description
---------------

Testing the API Version
-----------------------

All RPC extensions for Supervisor follow a convention where a method called
`getAPIVersion()` is available. supervisor_twiddler provides this:

.. code-block:: python

    twiddler.getAPIVersion()

It is highly recommended that when you develop software that uses
supervisor_twiddler, you test the API version before making method calls.

Listing Process Groups
----------------------

Process groups are defined in supervisord.conf as group sections. Assume
`supervisord.conf` contained sections `[group:foo]` and `[group:bar]`:

.. code-block:: python

    twiddler.getGroupNames()

The return value would then return an array: `["foo", "bar"]`. It is possible
to use supervisor_twiddler to add new process groups at runtime, and these
will also be included in the results returned by `twiddler.getGroupNames()`.

Adding a New Program to a Group
-------------------------------

In supervisord.conf, a `[program:x]` section will result in one or more
processes, depending on `numprocs` and named by `process_name`.

The `twiddler.addProgramToGroup()` method makes it possible to add a new program
to a group (resulting in one or more processes) and then control these
processes as if they had existed originally in `supervisord.conf`.

.. code:: python

    twiddler.addProgramToGroup("group_name", "foo",
      {"command": "/usr/bin/foo"})

The first parameter (`group_name`) is the group name where the new process will
belong. While there is no restriction on what groups can be used, it is
recommended that you keep your `supervisord.conf` groups static. You can add new
process groups just for your dynamic processes, and this will help you track
them easier.

The second parameter (`foo`) is the name of the new program to add to the group,
as it would have been written in the `[program:foo]` section `supervisord.conf`.

The final parameter is a dict (XML-RPC "struct") containing the program
options. These are the same options as in the `supervisor.conf` program section
and follow the same rules. The only required key is `command`.

When you add a program in this way and do not specify the autostart option,
the process will start on the next transition of Supervisor's state machine
(almost immediately). You might want to set autostart to `false` and then
start the process with `supervisor.startProcess()`.

Similarly, you might want to set autorestart to `false` if you don't want
Supervisor to restart it immediately after it exits.

If the process you are adding exits quickly, make sure that you set `startsecs`
to `0`. Otherwise, Supervisor will think the process failed to start and will
give an abnormal termination error.

Removing a Process from a Group
-------------------------------

When processes are no longer needed in the supervisord runtime configuration,
the `twiddler.removeProcessFromGroup()` method can be used:

.. code:: python

    twiddler.removeProcessFromGroup("group_name", "process_name")

To be removed, the process must not be running. It must have terminated on its
own or have been stopped with `supervisor.stopProcess()`.

Logging a Message
-----------------

The `twiddler.log()` method allows you to write arbitrary messages to
Supervisor's main log. When you twiddle with Supervisor's configuration, this
method is useful for logging messages about what was done.

.. code:: python

    twiddler.log("This is an informational message", "INFO")

The first argument is a string message to write to the log. The second
argument is the log level and is optional (defaults to `INFO`). The log level
may be a string or an integer.

Log levels are defined in the supervisor.loggers module and at the time of
writing are: `CRIT` (50), `ERRO` (40), `WARN` (30), `INFO` (20), `DEBG` (10),
`TRAC` (5), and `BLAT` (3).

Warnings
--------

Any changes to the supervisord runtime configuration will not be persisted
after Supervisor is shut down.

Your Supervisor instance should never be exposed to the outside world. With
supervisor_twiddler, anyone with access to the API has the ability to run
arbitrary commands on the server.
