        qmpy is a loose framework of tools for undertaking large computational 
        materials projects, targeted specifically at database of density functional
        theory calculations but largely flexible to individual needs. The emphasis is 
        on simplifying the day-to-day work of computational materials science, to let
        you get to the science.
