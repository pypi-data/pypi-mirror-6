Description: SDMX
        ====
        
        Read SDMX XML files. I've only added the features I've needed, so this
        is far from being a thorough implementation. Contributions welcome.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``pip install sdmx``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ``sdmx.generic_data_message_reader(fileobj)``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Given a file-like object representing the XML of a generic data message,
        return a data message reader.
        
        ``sdmx.compact_data_message_reader(fileobj)``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Given a file-like object representing the XML of a compact data message,
        return a data message reader.
        
        Data message readers
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Each data message reader has the following attributes:
        
        -  ``datasets()``: returns an iterable of ``DatasetReader`` instances.
           Each instance corresponds to a ``<DataSet>`` element.
        
        ``DatasetReader``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A ``DatasetReader`` has the following attributes:
        
        -  ``key_family()``: returns the ``KeyFamily`` for the dataset. This
           corresponds to the ``<KeyFamilyRef>`` element.
        
        -  ``series()``: returns an iterable of ``Series`` instances. Each
           instance corresponds to a ``<Series>`` element.
        
        ``KeyFamily``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A ``KeyFamily`` has the following attributes:
        
        -  ``name(lang)``: the name of the key family in the language ``lang``.
        
        -  ``describe_dimensions(lang)``: for each dimension of the key family,
           find the referenced concept and use its name in the language
           ``lang``. Returns a list of strings in the same order as in the
           source file.
        
        ``Series``
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A ``Series`` has the following attributes:
        
        -  ``describe_key(lang)``: the key of a series is a mapping from each
           dimension of the dataset to a value. For instance, if the dataset has
           a dimension named ``Country``, the value for the series might be
           ``United Kingdom``. Returns an ordered dictionary mapping strings to
           lists of strings. For instance, if the dataset has a single dimension
           called ``Country``, the returned value would be
           ``{"Country": ["United Kingdom"]}``. All ancestors of a value are
           also described, with ancestors appearing before descendents. For
           instance, if the value ``United Kingdom`` has the parent value
           ``Europe``, which has the parent value ``World``, the returned value
           would be ``{"Country": ["World", "Europe", "United Kingdom"]}``.
        
        -  ``observations()``: returns an iterable of ``Observation`` instances.
           Each instance corresponds to an ``<Obs>`` element.
        
        ``Observation``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        An ``Observation`` has the following attributes:
        
        -  ``time``
        -  ``value``
