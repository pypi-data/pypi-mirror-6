Description: [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com/) plugin that uses a validator
        to process extraclusions.
        
        # Intro
        
        An extraclusion is markup in renderable wikitext which extracts
        the contained text to a tiddler of its own. For example if the
        following text were put as tiddler "foo":
        
            # Header
        
            Some text
        
            .extraclude bar
        
            ## Other Header
        
            Other text
        
            .extraclude
        
            # Another Header
        
            Hi!
        
        The result would be two tiddlers in the same bag, "foo" and "bar".
        "foo" would contain markup to trainsclude "bar".
        
        The extracluded tiddlers inherits the `type` of the parent.
        
        # Install
        
        Install the Python package with:
        
            pip install -U tiddlywepblugins.extraclude
        
        
        Add the package to `system_plugins` in `tiddlywebconfig.py`:
        
            config = {
                'system_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.extraclude']
            }
