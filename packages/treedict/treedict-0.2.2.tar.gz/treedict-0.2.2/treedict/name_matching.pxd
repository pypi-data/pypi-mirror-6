# We include several elements here in calculating the distances to
# provide the best match.

# We use a function that calculates the levenshtein distance between
# two strings.  This version is pretty vanilla, with a few
# optimization tricks thrown in (e.g. prune the ends).  However, we
# want to weight the results so that starting overlaps are weighted
# closer.
