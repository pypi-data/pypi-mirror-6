Description: 
        
        This module implements a timesheet system.
        ==========================================
        
        Each employee can encode and track their time spent on the different projects.
        A project is an analytic account and the time spent on a project generates costs on
        the analytic account.
        
        Lots of reporting on time and employee tracking are provided.
        
        It is completely integrated with the cost accounting module. It allows you to set
        up a management by affair.
