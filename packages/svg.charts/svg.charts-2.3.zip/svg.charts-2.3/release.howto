How to make a release:

- Double-check that readme includes historical changes.
- Use Mercurial to tag the released version and push.
- Run release-package (from jaraco.util) in the current directory. This uploads to pypi.
- upload released packages to sourceforge (pscp .\dist\svg.charts*.zip 'jaraco,svg-charts@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/s/sv/svg-charts/')?
- announce release on python-announce-list@python.org
