        :param subparser:
            Since Engineer's built-in commands are subparsers, :meth:`~argparse.ArgumentParser.add_subparsers` is
            called to generate a subparser. :mod:`argparse` only supports
            calling :meth:`~argparse.ArgumentParser.add_subparsers` once, so the subparser object itself (the result
            of the initial :meth:`~argparse.ArgumentParser.add_subparsers` call Engineer made when building its
            parser) is passed in this parameter. This allows you to add either another top-level command by calling
            ``add_parser()`` then adding arguments directly, or to create further nested commands by adding a parser
            with additional subparsers within it.

        :param main_parser:
            The top level :class:`~argparse.ArgumentParser` used by Engineer. This is generally only useful if you're
            using an :mod:`argparse` wrapper library such as `argh <http://packages.python.org/argh/index.html>`_ in
            your plugin. Most wrapper libraries require the root :class:`~argparse.ArgumentParser` object to add their
            subparsers to. If you're using :mod:`argparse` directly, you can ignore this parameter and work with
            the ``subparser`` parameter exclusively.

        :param common_parser:
            Engineer provides several :ref:`common arguments<engineer>` for its commands. If you wish to makes these
            arguments available for your custom commands, you should pass ``common_parser`` in
            to ``add_parser()`` via the ``parents`` parameter.
