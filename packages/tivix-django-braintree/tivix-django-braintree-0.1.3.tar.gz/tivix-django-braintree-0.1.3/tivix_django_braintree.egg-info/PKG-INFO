        Installation
        ------------
        
        - Install django_braintree (ideally in your virtualenv!) using pip or simply getting a copy of the code and putting it in a directory in your codebase.
        
            ``pip install tivix-django-braintree``
        
        
        - Add ``django_braintree`` to your Django settings ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
        	INSTALLED_APPS = [
                # ...
                "django_braintree",
            ]
        
        - Add these lines in settings.py file::
        
            BRAINTREE_MERCHANT = 'your_merchant_key'
            BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your_public_key'
            BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY = 'your_private_key'
        
            from braintree import Configuration, Environment
        
            Configuration.configure(
                Environment.Sandbox,
                BRAINTREE_MERCHANT,
                BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY,
                BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY
            )
        
        - Add url to urls.py::
        
            url(r'', include('django_braintree.urls')),
        
        - If you're using South for schema migrations run ``python manage.py migrate django_braintree`` or simply do a ``syncdb``.
        
        
        Additional Information
        ----------------------
        
        - Braintree uses default templates::
        
            django_braintree/payments_billing.html
            django_braintree/fragments/cc_form.html
            django_braintree/fragments/current_cc_info.html
            django_braintree/fragments/pay.html
            django_braintree/fragments/payments_billing.html
        
        - Braintree requires including the js from ``django_common`` that enables ajax forms etc. ``django_common`` is available at https://github.com/Tivix/django-common
        - If a template variable ``cc_form_post_url`` is passed to the template then this form posts to it, otherwise it posts to the url ``payments_billing``.
        - If a template variable ``cc_form_success_redirect_url`` is passed it takes user to that url then after form post has succeeded.
        - Braintree is set up to sandbox mode at default. To change this you must switch ``Environment.Sandbox`` to ``Environment.Production`` in settings file.
