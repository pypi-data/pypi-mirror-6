Description: # Research Object manager command line tool
        
        **Author: Graham Klyne (graham.klyne@zoo.ox.ac.uk)**
        
        Research Objects are semantically rich aggregations of resources that bring
        together data, methods and people in scientific investigations.  For further
        information, see:
        * What is an RO?

          - http://wf4ever.github.com/ro/
        
        Research Object Manager (RO Manager) is a simple command line tool for creating and
        manipulating Research Objects in a local file system, and for exchanging them with a
        Research Object Digital Library (RODL):

        * Python pip utility, or git, depending on the installation option used.
        
        
        ## Installation overview
        
        This is just a summary of the installation options.
        More detailed explanations can be found below.
        
        There are two main options for installation: the first is from the Python 
        Package Index (PyPI) which requires that the Python pip utility is installed:
        
            pip install ro-manager
            ro-manager-test
        
        The other option is to take a copy of the source code from GitHub, and install
        from that, which requires that the git source code management tool is
        installed:
        
            cd (some working directory)
            git clone https://github.com/wf4ever/ro-manager.git ro-manager
            cd ro-manager/src
            python setup.py build
            python setup.py install
            ro-manager-test

        Once pip is installed, it can be used to install virtualenv, if needed.
        
        
        ## System-wide install from PyPI
        
        RO-manager can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using 'pip'.
        
        This is the simplest option for installing RO Manager, and does not require
        a copy of the RO Manager code be obtained from GitHub, but generally does
        require that you have root access on the computer where it is installed:
        
        Prerequisites are python 2.7 (http://python.org/download/releases/2.7/) and 
        pip (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip, http://www.pip-installer.org/).
        
        1. Install:
        
                sudo pip install ro-manager
        
            (You may be asked for a password to confirm root access privilege.)
        
        2. Test:
        
                ro help
        
        
        ## "Virtual environment" install from PyPI
        
        If you don't have root privileges, or if you want to create a temporary
        or local copy of the RO Manager installation, this can be done using the
        Python "virtual environment" facility.  The following assumes that Python
        "virtualenv" is installed (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv),  This
        method does not require that a copy of RO Manager software be obtained
        from GitHub.  A disadvantage of this method is that the Python virtual
        environment must always be activated in order to run RO Manager.
        
        You will need to choose a working directory where the Python virtual 
        environment will be created.  We'll call this $RO_MANAGER.
        
        Prerequisites are python 2.7 (http://python.org/download/releases/2.7/),
        virtualenv (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and 
        pip (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip, http://www.pip-installer.org/).
        
        1. Create and activate virtual environment:
        
                cd $RO_Manager
                virtualenv roenv
                source roenv/bin/activate
        
            To subsequently revert to the system default Python environment:
           
                deactivate
        
            To remove a temporary virtual environment, including any software
            that has been installed there:
        
                deactivate
                rm -rf $RO_MANAGER/roenv
        
        2. Install RO Manager:
        
                pip install ro-manager
        
        3. Test:
        
                ro help
        
        
        ## To install from GitHub
        
        RO Manager can also be installed using a copy of the software obtained
        from GitHub.  This may be advantageous if you need to access the most
        recent version of the software.  (The copy uploaded to PyPI may lag the
        development copy in GitHub.)
        
        Prerequisites are python 2.7 (http://python.org/download/releases/2.7/) and git (http://git-scm.com/).
        
        1. Obtain a copy of software from GitHub:
        
            In the first instance, the command used will be a "git clone ...":
        
            Choose a working directory where the RO Manager software will be
            stored:
        
                cd (working directory)
                git clone https://github.com/wf4ever/ro-manager.git ro-manager
                cd ro-manager
        
            The current working directory is now the $RO_MANAGER directory.
        
            To obtain subsequent updates, go into the ro-manager directory
            tree and use "git pull":
           
                cd $RO_MANAGER
                git pull
        
        2. (Optional) Use Python virtualenv to create and activate an environment
           for installing RO manager.  There are two advantages to doing this:
           (a) not needing root privileges to install ro-manager, and 
           (b) using a Python environment version different from the system default.
           The main disadvantage of using a new Python virtual environment is
           that it must be activated every time before RO Manager can be run.
        
                cd $RO_Manager
                virtualenv roenv
                source roenv/bin/activate
        
        3. Go to directory $RO_MANAGER/src
        
                cd $RO_MANAGER/src
        
        4. Build the installation package:
        
                python setup.py build
        
        5. Install the package and its dependencies
        
            If installing into a Python virtual environment:
        
                python setup.py install
           
            If *not* installing into a Python virtual environment, 
            this command must be run as root:
           
                sudo python setup.py install
        
        6. Test the installation
        
                ro-manager-test
        
            The following should be displayed:
        
                $ ro-manager-test 
                .......................................................................................................
                ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                Ran 103 tests in 13.406s
            
                OK
                $ 
        
            Note that (on some systems, including MacOS), if RO Manager is installed under
            the system Python environment (i.e. not using virtualenv) then a small number of
            test cases that access test data files may fail.  If the majority of tests pass,
            and the ro command appears to work, the installation is probably fine.
        
        7. To run RO manager to display a summary of commands and options:
        
                ro help
        
        
        ## Using RO Manager
        
        See also the documentation at http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+management+tool
        
        Directory $RO_MANAGER/src/samples contains some bash shell scripts that are 
        examples for creating, annotating and displaying simple Research Objects.
        
        Note that the ro config command needs to be run to set up a 
        configuration for your environment, though it can be re-run to update 
        the details.  Most ro config values are currently ignored.  The important 
        value is -b <robase>, which indicates a disk area where Research Objects
        are managed.
        
        Look inside the file $RO_MANAGER/src/samples/ro_sample.sh to see what the 
        individual commands used look like.
        
        For example, to create and manipulate a simple example Research Object:
        
            cd $RO_MANAGER/src/samples
            ./ro_sample.sh
        
        The output should look something like this:
        
            $ ./ro_sample.sh

        * Add `ro link` command; this works just like `ro annotate`, except that the default treatment of the target value (i.e. for unrecognized annotation types) is as a URI, this providing a mechanism to create arbitrary links between RO resources, or between an RO resource and an external resource.
        * Allow annotation and links  with CURIE (QName) properties.  A predefined set of recognized URI prefixes are defined (see `~/.ro-config`) which can be used to create annotations with CURIES; e.g. `ro link foo rdfs:seeAlso bar`.
        * Create multiple annotations and links with wildcard resource matching; e.g. `ro link -w "/workflow/.*t2flow$" rdf:type wfdesc:Workflow" will create an rdf:type wfdesc:Workflow link for all aggregated resources in a directory named "/Workflow" and with file extension ".t2flow".
        * ROSRS (v6) support
        * Support for checklist evaluation of ROs stored in RODL or some other ROSRS service (used primarily by the `roweb` service component)
        * Decouple MINIM constraints from target RO.  Allow creation of MINIM descriptions that can be applied to arbitrary ROs:  this paves the way for creating and using checklists that encode community norms for RO quality.
