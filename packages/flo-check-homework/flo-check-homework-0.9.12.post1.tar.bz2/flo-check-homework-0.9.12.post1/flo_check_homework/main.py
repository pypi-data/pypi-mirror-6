            #      Linux, via a #ifdef test. Moreover, the order of the fields

            #      may be holes, etc.).

            #      uses the constants of flock and not of the POSIX lockf
            #      function and it actually is nothing else than an interface
            #      to fcntl(2) locking), could be useful but it doesn't allow

            #      set a lock on a portion of a file, although the underlying

         the size hint width/height when the corresponding scroll bar policy
         is one of ScrollBarAlwaysOn, ScrollBarAsNeeded. In contrast, the
         original implementation only does this in the ScrollBarAlwaysOn case.

      2) The upper bound for the returned QSize is increased from its default
         of (36 * h, 24 * h) in the hope of avoiding the use of scroll bars
         for not-too-small sizes. However, this can be rendered ineffective by
