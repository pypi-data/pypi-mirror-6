Inputs::

        [Mandatory]
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

        [Optional]
        args: (a string)
                Additional parameters to the command
        defaultValue: (a float)
                Default voxel value
        deformationVolume: (an existing file name)
                Displacement Field to be used to warp the image
        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a value of type 'str' and
                 with values which are a value of type 'str', nipype default value:
                 {})
                Environment variables
        gridSpacing: (an integer)
                Add warped grid to output image to help show the deformation that
                occured with specified spacing. A spacing of 0 in a dimension
                indicates that grid lines should be rendered to fall exactly (i.e.
                do not allow displacements off that plane). This is useful for
                makeing a 2D image of grid lines from the 3D space
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)
                Print an error message instead of throwing an exception in case the
                interface fails to run
        inputVolume: (an existing file name)
                Image To Warp
        interpolationMode: ('NearestNeighbor' or 'Linear' or
                 'ResampleInPlace' or 'BSpline' or 'WindowedSinc' or 'Hamming' or
                 'Cosine' or 'Welch' or 'Lanczos' or 'Blackman')
                Type of interpolation to be used when applying transform to moving
                volume. Options are Linear, ResampleInPlace, NearestNeighbor,
                BSpline, or WindowedSinc
        inverseTransform: (a boolean)
                True/False is to compute inverse of given transformation. Default is
                false
        numberOfThreads: (an integer)
                Explicitly specify the maximum number of threads to use.
        outputVolume: (a boolean or a file name)
                Resulting deformed image
        pixelType: ('float' or 'short' or 'ushort' or 'int' or 'uint' or
                 'uchar' or 'binary')
                Specifies the pixel type for the input/output images. The 'binary'
                pixel type uses a modified algorithm whereby the image is read in as
                unsigned char, a signed distance map is created, signed distance map
                is resampled, and then a thresholded image of type unsigned char is
                written to disk.
        referenceVolume: (an existing file name)
                Reference image used only to define the output space. If not
                specified, the warping is done in the same space as the image to
                warp.
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal
                immediately, `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored
        warpTransform: (an existing file name)
                Filename for the BRAINSFit transform used in place of the
                deformation field

Outputs::

        outputVolume: (an existing file name)
                Resulting deformed image
