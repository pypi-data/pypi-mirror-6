Priority settings
=================

Why?
----

This document lists the different priority settings that determine where an
addable falls in various listings (such as such the addables screen or the add
select list). They apply to <silva:content> and <silva:versionedcontent>
metatypes (aka addables) in Silva and Silva extensions. This listing helps
reduce priority conflicts for existing and newly developed products. Please
list any new priority numbers here.

A few notes about reserved priority numbers:
1. negatives are reserved for Silva core metatypes
2. the 3 range is reserved for SilvaNewsNetwork
3. if in doubt, set it explicitly to zero

If an addable has no priority setting, thus defaulting to zero, it'll appear in
the middle of a listing, after the negatives and before any positives. Addables
with the same priority (e.g. 0) are presented in alphabetical order, as below.

Probably it's better not to set a priority, because whether an item is an
extension or not is only important to developers. For Authors, if the listing
is alphabetical they'll look for an addable accordingly. However if you create
an extension with multiple addables, and you want to group them together, then
it makes sense to add priorities.

Silva 2.3 and later
-------------------

However, as of Silva 2.3 container objects inherit a priority from SilvaFolder
or SilvaPublication. They must have their priority explicitly set to zero in
order to appear correctly in the default alphabetical listing. For an example
see SilvaForum which has:

    silvaconf.priority(0)
