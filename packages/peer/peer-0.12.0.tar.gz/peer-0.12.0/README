Public Endpoint Entities Registry

PEER is envisioned as a lightweight, global registrar for SAML Metadata
representing both SAML and non-SAML endpoints (e.g., OpenID, IMI). It is
intended as a focused activity to catalyze international use of federated
identity. The service is not intended to be a replacement for federation
or inter-federation, but is intended to be a tool supporting such activities.
