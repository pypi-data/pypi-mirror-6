        vdirsyncer synchronizes your calendars and addressbooks between two storages.
        The supported storages are CalDAV, CardDAV, arbitrary HTTP resources and
        `vdir <https://github.com/untitaker/vdir>`_.
        
        While i use it daily and haven't experienced data loss (even when vdirsyncer
        crashed), i don't know if the documentation is sufficient. If you have any
        questions regarding the usage, feel free to open a new issue.
        
        It aims to be for CalDAV and CardDAV what
        `OfflineIMAP <http://offlineimap.org/>`_ is for IMAP.

        =============================
        
        vdirsyncer is currently tested against the latest versions Radicale and
        ownCloud. While Radicale seems to work perfectly, ownCloud currently has
        problems detecting collisions and race-conditions. However, given that this is
        a problem with every setup involving ownCloud, and that ownCloud is widely
        used, it apparently isn't big enough of a problem yet.
        
        See `Bug #16 <https://github.com/untitaker/vdirsyncer/issues/16>`_ for
        informations on problems with ownCloud.
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        As all Python packages, vdirsyncer can be installed with ``pip``::
        
            pip install --user vdirsyncer  # use the pip for Python 2
        
        Then copy ``example.cfg`` to ``~/.vdirsyncer/config`` and edit it. You can use the
        `VDIRSYNCER_CONFIG` environment variable to change the path vdirsyncer will
        read the config from.
        
        Run ``vdirsyncer --help``. If you experience any problems, consult the `wiki's
        troubleshooting page
        <https://github.com/untitaker/vdirsyncer/wiki/Troubleshooting>`_ or create a
        new issue.
