===================
 Partial Rendering
===================

Modern websites often (re-)load parts of the page using javascript.
|TDI| attempts to help you somewhat with such demands. It provides the
possibility to render only a subnode of the template. Imagine a menu
which is reloaded dynamically. Imagine further that you don't need to
change a thing (compared to loading the whole page) except to say, which
node should be rendered now. Here it comes:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/partial.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: BEGIN INCLUDE
    :end-before: END INCLUDE

The "partial rendering" feature is triggered by the ``startnode``
argument, which addresses the node symbolically. A dotted notation
is allowed in order to specify a specificly nested node. See the
:tdi:`tdi.nodetree.Root./render()` method API documentation for more
details.

The output now contains the desired node only:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/out/partial.out
    :language: html


.. vim: ft=rest tw=72
