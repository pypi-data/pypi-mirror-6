Description: ===============================================================================
        Program allowing to run other programs only after some "homework" has been done
        ===============================================================================
        A way to consolidate calculus and grammar skills
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        General idea
        ------------
        
        flo-check-homework presents one or more questionnaires to the user. Once all
        questions have been answered, and if the score exceeds a predefined threshold,
        a special button is enabled. When pressed, this button launches the program
        (with optional arguments) that was specified on flo-check-homework's command
        line.
        
        A "magic formula" button allows one to bypass the test in case the pupil has
        already done his homework in another way. It also makes it possible to exit
        the program immediately.
        
        Indeed, flo-check-homework refuses to quit immediately unless option -e was
        given or a sufficient score was obtained; this is done so as to avoid the
        children validating the whole questionnaire with incorrect answers only to get
        corrections that they can blindly copy after rerunning the program. For the
        same reason, some of the question generators purposedly don't remember
        incorrect answers, in contrast with the initial design.
        
        Currently, the questions are designed to help consolidate simple additions,
        substractions, multiplications, euclidian divisions and conjugations of French
        verbs. The questionnaires are built at run-time and can be customized to some
        extent via a configuration file
        (~/.config/Florent Rougon/flo-check-homework.ini on Unix-like systems). It is
        easy for a Python programmer to add new question generators, questionnaires or
        subquestionnaires.
        
        The ItemGenerator class, which is the basis for many question generators, has
        the following properties:
        
          - starts with items that have been incorrectly answered in previous sessions
          - cycles through all items but does not yield an item that has already been
            seen in the current session (unless all items have been seen)
          - Seen objects (used to remember which items of a given type have been seen
            in the current session) can be shared between several question generators.
            This avoids asking the same question twice in case several question
            generators are likely to generate the same question.
        
        It is possible to setup launcher scripts that call flo-check-homework with the
        appropriate parameters depending on the script (and parameters passed to the
        script). The flo-check-homework-decorate-games program from the 'tools'
        directory is provided to help automate such a setup. Basically, you write a
        list of programs/games in an XML file which we'll call DATAFILE for the sake
        of the example. You may look at flo-check-homework-decorate-games.xml from the
        tools/flo-check-homework-decorate-games folder or run
        'flo-check-homework-decorate-games --help' for an example of such a file. Once
        you have a proper DATAFILE, run the following command as a user who has
        permission to write to /usr/local/games::
        
          # flo-check-homework-decorate-games /path/to/DATAFILE
        
        This will create an appropriate launcher script in /usr/local/games for every
        program listed in DATAFILE. If /usr/local/games is prepended to the system
        PATH, then the launcher scripts will take precedence over the corresponding
        game executables when a user tries to run a game, unless a full path to the
        game executable is specified.
        
        This also works if the game is started from the freedesktop_ menu, because
        freedesktop .desktop files usually don't specify a full path to the executable
        (when they do, the only recourse is to fix the .desktop file manually and
        report a bug to the game in question). The format of .desktop files is
        described in the `Desktop Entry specification`_.
        
        flo-check-homework-decorate-games has options to customize the paths such as
        /usr/games and /usr/local/games, as well as options to choose which locale to
        use when a launcher script starts flo-check-homework, and when
        flo-check-homework runs a game. See the output of
        'flo-check-homework-decorate-games --help' for more information.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        The following software is required to run flo-check-homework:
        
          - Python 3.1 or later in the 3 series;
          - Qt 4.8 or later;
          - PyQt 4.10.3 is known to work, version 4.9 should be enough and older
            versions will most probably not work with this version of
            flo-check-homework.
        
        Version 0.9.12 of flo-check-homework has been tested on Linux with
        Python 3.3.2, Qt 4.8.2 and PyQt 4.10.3. It should work on any platform with
        the aforementioned dependencies installed, but trivial bugs are likely to pop
        up on non-Unix platforms as no test whatsoever has been done on them. Please
        report.
        
        For installation instructions, please refer to INSTALL.txt.
        
        
        Running flo-check-homework from the Git repository
        --------------------------------------------------
        
        flo-check-homework is maintained in a `Git repository
        <https://github.com/frougon/flo-check-homework>`_ that can be cloned with::
        
          git clone https://github.com/frougon/flo-check-homework
        
        It is possible to run flo-check-homework from a clone of that repository, but
        two things that are not part of it have to be set up in order for everything
        to work properly:
        
          - the flo_check_homework/images directory tree containing “reward images”
            must be copied from a release tarball, otherwise there will be an error
            when all questions have been answered and the program tries to show an
            image;
          - the .qm files (used for translations) that are relevant to your locale
            settings must be generated from the corresponding .ts source files; this
            can be done automatically with the Makefile shipped in the top-level
            directory of the Git repository, provided you have GNU Make (run 'make').
        
        
        Additional notes
        ----------------
        
        Since flo-check-homework-decorate-games is currently only able to generate
        shell scripts, it is not expected to be of any use on platforms that cannot
        run them. This means that you can fill in questionnaires on these platforms
        but can't expect to be able to run the desired program/games from
        flo-check-homework after a good enough work without some adaptation for such
        platforms. (For Windows platforms, one might use Cygwin or adapt
        flo-check-homework-decorate-games to generate batch files, or something else,
        let Windows experts decide in this matter...)
        
        All images, as the rest of the package, are free according to the `Debian Free
        Software Guidelines`_ (DFSG-free for short). I wanted to use photos of
        angry-looking dogs easily found with Google Images, but unfortunately, they
        all appear to be non-free. If you have good suggestions of free
        software-licensed images to improve this program, please advise.
