EMIR Data Products
==================

Each recipe of the EMIR Pipeline produces a set of predefined results, known
as *data products*. In turn, the recipes may request diferent data products
as computing requeriments, efectively chaining the recipes.

For example, the requirements of the :ref:`ff-recipe-label` recipe include a
:class:`~emir.dataproducts.MasterDark` object. This object is produced by 
the recipe :class:`~emir.recipes.DarkRecipe`, which in turn requires a 
:class:`~emir.dataproducts.MasterBias` object.

Image data products

These data products are saved to disk as FITS files. PyEmir makes use of the FITS headers
to record information about the data processing. This information may be recorded using other
methods as well, such as the GTC Database or the standalone Pontifex database.

The following headers are included in all image data products and record information
about the version of Numina and the name and version of the recipe used.

  ::

   NUMXVER = '0.7.0   '           / Numina package version                         
   NUMRNAM = 'DitheredImageRecipe' / Numina recipe name                            
   NUMRVER = '0.1.0   '           / Numina recipe version                                     
   NUMTYP  = 'TARGET  '           / Data product type  

``HISTORY`` keywords may be used also, but the information in these keyword may not be easily indexed.

Master Bias frames
*******************

Bias frames are produced by the recipe :class:`~emir.recipes.BiasRecipe`. Each bias frame is a 
multiextension FITS file with the following extensions.

  ===============    =======   ========   =======================
  Extension name     Type      Version    Contents
  ===============    =======   ========   =======================
  ``PRIMARY``        Primary              The bias level
  ``VARIANCE``       Image     1          Variance of the bias level obtained from the input frames
  ``VARIANCE``       Image     2          Variance of the bias level measured on the result frame
  ``MAP``            Image                Number of pixels used to compute the bias level
  ===============    =======   ========   =======================

Master Dark frames
******************

Master dark frames are produced by the recipe :class:`~emir.recipes.DarkRecipe`. Each dark frame is a 
multiextension FITS file with the following extensions.

  ===============    =======   ========   =======================
  Extension name     Type      Version    Contents
  ===============    =======   ========   =======================
  ``PRIMARY``        Primary              The dark level
  ``VARIANCE``       Image     1          Variance of the dark level obtained from the input frames
  ``VARIANCE``       Image     2          Variance of the dark level measured on the result frame
  ``MAP``            Image                Number of pixels used to compute the dark level
