Related Autocomplete Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This filter is similar to a regular foreign key field filter, with two
differences:

-  it has a nice AJAX-powered autocomplete UI (straight from Grappelli)
-  does not load all possible filter values in HTML - good for
   situations with many of related objects

Usage
'''''

Configure Grappelli autocomplete feature as described `here`_. Both
Model method and ``SETTINGS`` value will work fine. For the inpatient,
here is the ``SETTINGS`` value:

::

    GRAPPELLI_AUTOCOMPLETE_SEARCH_FIELDS = {
        "myapp": {
            "mycategory": ("id__iexact", "name__icontains",),
        }
    }

In ``admin.py`` add:

::

    from grappelli_filters import RelatedAutocompleteFilter, FiltersMixin

    class MyModelAdmin(FiltersMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
        list_filter = ( ... ('field_name', RelatedAutocompleteFilter), ... )
        

Search Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This filter allows string searches over a single field. Several filters
combined provide better control over the resulting list then does the
built-in django-admin ``search_fields`` feature.

Usage
'''''

In admin.py add:

::

    from grappelli_filters SearchFilter

    class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        list_filter = ( ... ('field_name', SearchFilter), ... )
        

Case-sensitive Search Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to Search Filter, but searches are case-sensitive.

Usage
'''''

Use ``SearchFilterC`` instead of ``SearchFilter``
