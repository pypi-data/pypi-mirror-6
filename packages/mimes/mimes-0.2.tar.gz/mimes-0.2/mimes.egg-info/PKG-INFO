        An internet MIME-message is usually accompanied by a content-type string like
        ``text/plain`` or ``application/collection+json``. The mimes library allows
        parsing these and can if types are subsets of another -- a parser that handles
        ``application/json``, for example, will be perfectly fine handing the
        collection+json type with less semantics.
        
        It also parses more complex strings including parameters (e.g.
        ``application/vnd.company.someapi; version=3``) and can construct these as
        well.
        
        See the `docs <http://pythonhosted.org/mimes>`_ for details.
