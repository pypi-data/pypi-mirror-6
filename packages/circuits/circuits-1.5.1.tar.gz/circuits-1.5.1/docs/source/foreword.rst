Foreword
========

circuits was a reincarnation of a design architecture that the author had been
working on since mid-2004. It was then part of the pymills project
(*named so after the author*) and was just a single module: ``pymills.event``

It was an architecture inspired from learning
`Behavior Trees <http://www.sqi.gu.edu.au/gse/>`_ while studying
Software Engineering at `Griffith University <http://www.griffith.edu.au>`_
and quickly grew into a useful and successful framework to build more
complex systems and applications with.

circuits became what it is today by the encouragement of a co-worker of a
start-up company at the time and was rebranded into it's own project.
