Description: 
        Provides the script ncdistributer.py that will package up a python script together with any non-standard libraries into a zip file
        that can be executed on a computer with a python interpreter installed.
        
        It is similar to tools such as pyzzer, but aims to be even more straight-forward to use.
        
        Unlike projects such as Cython and Nuitka, the this aim of this tool is not to distribute a binary file, but to distribute 
        a python package that will work on standard installations of python.
