Description: 
        MyKeys is a simple library to help with roaming various OAuth keys and secrets.
        
        OAuth key/secret pairs granted by various websites (like Twitter, GoodReads etc.)
        shouldn't be checked into public repositories. Storing them in config files
        or env variables is possible, but makes roaming them inconvenient.
        
        MyKeys provides a simple interface to parse key/secret pairs from a standard
        config file.
        
        This file can be pushed to a private repository, roamed via DropBox etc. so
        it can be moved across machines privately.
