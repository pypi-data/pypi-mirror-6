Description: ========================
        OpenID Support for Silva
        ========================
        
        This extension provides full support for OpenID in Silva. It relies on
        PluggableAuthService and ``silva.pas.base``.
        
        After installing the extension, visitors will be able to login to Silva
        using an OpenID identity. First, visitors will have to register their OpenID
        via a form protected by a captcha. This registration step will fetch the
        available information about the user from the OpenID provider and add it to
        the Silva member object. After registration, site managers can assign roles
        to the new users.
        
        This extension requires at least `Silva`_ 3.x or higher. For previous
        versions of Silva, please use previous versions of this extension.

        =======
        
        Silva's OpenID integration was sponsored by Marc Petitmermet, who's at the
        Department of Materials at ETH Zurich (http://www.mat.ethz.ch/) but the
        funding came from another source.
