This is the documentation directory of pyhsm.

----
API documentation
----

In doc/html/ you will find API documentation generated from pydoc in the
source tree at the time of release.

If you have checked out the source code from the repository rather than
downloaded an official release, you can generate the HTML API documentation
yourself by installing 'epydoc' (package 'python-epydoc' in Debian/Ubuntu)
and then executing the ./maintainer-scripts/generate_html.sh script.

----
Assorted usage documentation
----

All pages that were available in the project Wiki (currently located at
https://github.com/Yubico/python-pyhsm/wiki ) are included as-is in the
releases.

Please note that there might be more updated documentation available online.

If you want to update the contents of the doc/wiki/ directory with what is
currently available online, execute the following commands :

----
$ cd $top_srcdir
$ git submodule update --init
----


----
Low level documentation

The reference manual is available from
