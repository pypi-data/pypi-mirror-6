How to create a pypi release:

1. Update the version number by one on setup.py
2. Run all the tests, make sure it's solid
3. Register your user/machine with test pypi
> python setup.py register -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
4. Do a test build & upload:
> python setup.py sdist upload -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
5. If everything is successful, do the real thing: 
> python setup.py register
> python setup.py sdist upload
