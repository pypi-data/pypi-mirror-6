        =====
        
        `Silva`_ is a Zope-based web application designed for the creation and
        management of structured, textual content. Silva allows users to enter
        new documents as well as edit existing documents using a web
        interface.
        
        Silva stores the content in a structured format, and keeps a strict
        separation between the way the content is used and the way it is
        presented. This leads to several important advantages:
        
        * The same content can be used in different media, such as the web,
          paper, or word processor content. Web publication of content is
          native to Silva as it is based on Zope, but Silva also has export
          filters to various formats.
        
        * The content is future proofed and not out of date as soon as you
          want to use a new system or present it in a different way.
        
        * The structuring of the content facilitates more sophisticated
          searching and indexing.
        
        Silva supports (but does not require) a separation between authors who
        can create new content and editors who can approve whether content
        actually gets published. It also allows delegation of editing or
        authoring responsibilities of a section of the publication to
        others. Thus, users can be empowered (avoiding a single-person
        bottleneck), without the loss of editorial control.
        
        To assist in the publication process, Silva implements workflow where
        multiple versions of the same document are kept around at the same
        time. One version of a particular document may be published while
        another version can be edited at the same time.
        
        Silva is extensible with new document types and other types of content
        objects, others skins ...

        Changes
        =======
        
        Silva 3.0.4 (2013/12/23)
        ------------------------
        
        - Add a site-level quota feature. On the welcome form you get at the
          Zope root, you can configure a site-level quota for a given
          site. This quota cannot be changed from within the site.
        
        - Various services are now configurable in SMI under Site preferences.
        
        - Silva Ghost Asset have been added. They are ghost content for
          assets. When ghosting a Folder, Silva Ghost Asset will be created
          for each corresponding asset, instead of copying them over. The
          ghost code have been reviewed a cleaned a bit.
        
        Silva 3.0.3 (2013/10/09)
        ------------------------
        
        - Fix various bugs:
        
           - Regarding broken links and broken ghost.
        
           - Allow empty string as resize specifier for images.
        
        
        - Refactor icon support to support different icons for different file
          mimetypes.
        
        - Refactor and optimize how the last modification date and last author
          is set. It is now set on contents at the end of the request, just
          before the content is being re-index. This feature is disabled
          during upgrade (the last modification date and author are not set on
          content during upgrades).
        
        
        Silva 3.0.2 (2013/05/24)
        ------------------------
        
        - Fix various bugs:
        
          - You can no longer create a folder called index,
        
          - You can synchronise a copy of an outdated ghost folder,
        
          - Keep expiration date of a version if you make a new copy of it and
            the date is in the future.
        
        - Add support for customizing HTTP headers on most of the default
          Silva contents.
        
        - Rename metadata sets.
        
        - Add a method to repair the order of the ordered container.
        
        - Improve tests.
        
        Silva 3.0.1 (2013/03/06)
        ------------------------
        
        - Update Silva XML import and export feature to a new API that
          tolerate and report problems during the import. Performances of the
          export and import have been improved in order to consume less
          memory, to allow larger exports and imports.
        
        - Fix various bugs when an Image doesn't have any payload (meaning the
          image is missing).
        
        - Add a name chooser for Zope contents, that is used by the Silva Root
          add form.
        
        - Support symbolic links for extensions (meaning the path Zope see is
          a symbolic link to a real extension).
        
        - Silva Containers (Folder, Publications...) now provides a
          ``fulltext`` method.
        
        Silva 3.0 (2012/12/12)
        ----------------------

        - Improve tests.
        
        Silva 3.0c1 (2012/09/25)
        ------------------------
        
        - Split apart some more code in other packages. Reformat some API to
          follow pep8.
        
        - Use ``grokcore.chameleon``.
        
        - Usuability fixes.
        
        - Add support for a ``VersionedObject`` (and

        - Improve test coverage.
        
        - Fix various bugs from the beta.
        
        Silva 3.0b1 (2011/11/11)
        ------------------------
        
        - Base the SMI on top of ``silva.ui``. Most of screens are implemented
          in ``silva.core.smi`` and no longer here.
        
        - Major cleanup of the APIs, all methods used by the old SMI have been
          removed. When need, adapters provides the functionality now.
        
        - Silva root creation process have been reviewed, as a suite of
          events. This makes possible to have extension that plugs actions at
          that moment. There is no longer a large install method.
        
        - Built-in Kupu support have been removed.
        
        - XSLT support have been removed, and the renderer registry.
        
        - SilvaViews, FileSystemSite are no longer used and supported.
        
        - Old unused fake adapters have been removed.
        
        - ``view`` and ``preview`` methods on SilvaObject have been
          removed. It is now the job of the layout system to render them.
        
        - Update code for Zope 2.13 and Python 2.7.
