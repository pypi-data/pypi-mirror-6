BastionLedger - OrderBook

   Description

     An OrderBook is a subsidiary ledger specifically designed to take or
     place order with suppliers or customers.

     An OrderBook is linked to an Inventory from which to make order
     selections.

     Each account within the OrderBook represents either a customer or a 
     supplier.  It is possible to define and assign custom payment policies
     to each of these entities.
