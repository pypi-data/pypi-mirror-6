        ## Install
        
        The easiest way to install is with `pip`, it will download the package, build it and place `cexbot-cli` in your path. If you don't have `pip` on your
        machine see ["How do I install pip on OS X"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17271319/installing-pip-on-mac-os-x) (*tl;dr: `sudo easy_install pip` or `brew install python`*)
        
         `pip install cexbot`
        
        If you have previously installed cexbot you will need to run an upgrade:
        
         `pip -U install cexbot`
        
        ## Dev Install
        
        If you would like to contribute to the code:
        
         `git clone --depth=0 https://github.com/nikcub/cexbot.git`
        
         `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        
        ## Config
        
        cexbot needs to know your username, API key and secret.
        
        Configuration options are specified with the `config` command line option.
        
        ```
        $ cexbot-cli config --list
        Namespace(command='config', debug=False, list=True, name=None, value=None, verbose=False, version=False)
        cex.username = nikcub
        cex.secret = secret
        cex.apikey = api
        ```
        
        Set each config option with:
        
         `cexbot-cli config cex.username nikcub`
        
        and then set your api key and secret:
        
          `cexbot-cli config cex.apikey <your_key>`
        
          `cexbot-cli config cex.secret <your_secret>`
        
        If you have a local editor installed, you can edit your config directly with:
        
          `cexbot-cli config --edit`
        
        Once you have those values defined, you can test that they work with:
        
          `cexbot-cli config --testauth`
