Description: TideHunter
        ==========
        
        HTTP streaming toolbox with flow control, written in Python.
        
        |Build Status| |Coverage Status| |Downloads|
        
        Background
        ----------
        
        This project was born for a need in my day time job at Addictive
        Mobility (Addictive Tech Corp.). Before this project was open sourced,
        it went through two major overhauls. I briefly mentioned the techniques
        I used in previous versions in a `blog
        post <http://runzhou.li/blog/2013/07/02/tame-py-curl/>`__.
        
        Highlights
        ----------
        
        -  Accurate quota limit - total control over your stream quota.
        -  An instant off switch - when sht hits the fan and you don't want to
           crash your process.
        -  Redis backed control tools - semi-persisted, fast, and scalable.
        -  Core mechanisms based on the solid cURL and PycURL - inherits the
           built-in goodness (gzip support and more).
        -  OAuth support based on python-oauth2 - see `this
           demo <https://github.com/woozyking/tidehunter/blob/master/demo/five_tweets.py>`__
           in action.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install tidehunter
        
        Or to update:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install tidehunter --upgrade
        
        Note: the package will install all Python dependencies for you. However
        you need to have both cURL (the headers from dev package are also
        required for PycURL) and Redis installed.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Example 1 (with limit):
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from tidehunter.stream import StateCounter, Queue, Hunter
        
            # The state machine and record counter (state counter)
            sc = StateCounter(key='demo_sc', host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
        
            # The data queue
            q = Queue(key='demo_q', host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
        
            # The Hunter!
            conf = {
                'url': 'https://httpbin.org/stream/100',
                'limit': 5,  # desired limit
                'delimiter': '\n'
            }
            h = Hunter(conf=conf, sc=sc, q=q)
        
            # Start streaming
            h.tide_on()
        
            # Consume the data which should be in the data queue now
            while len(q):
                print q.get()  # profit x 5
        
            # You can re-use the same Hunter object, and add a one-time limit
            h.tide_on(limit=1)  # this time we only want one record
        
            assert len(q) == 1  # or else there's a bug, create an issue!
        
            print q.get()  # more profit
        
        Example 2 (without limit):
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Assume you have a process running the following code:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from tidehunter.stream import StateCounter, Queue, Hunter
        
            # The state machine and record counter (state counter)
            sc = StateCounter(key='demo_sc', host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
        
            # The data queue
            q = Queue(key='demo_q', host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
        
            # The Hunter!
            conf = {'url': 'https://some.forever.streaming.api.endpoint'}
            h = Hunter(conf=conf, sc=sc, q=q)
        
            # Start streaming, FOREVA
            h.tide_on()
        
        You can delegate the responsibility of data consumption and stream
        control to another process:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from tidehunter.stream import StateCounter, Queue
        
            # The SAME state machine and record counter (state counter)
            sc = StateCounter(key='demo_sc', host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
        
            # The SAME data queue
            q = Queue(key='demo_q', host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
        
            while sc.started():
                data = q.get()  # dequeue and
                # ...do something with data
        
                if SHT_HITS_THE_FAN:
                    sc.stop()  # instant off switch, end of while loop, as well as the process above
        
        See `demo <https://github.com/woozyking/tidehunter/tree/master/demo>`__
        for more examples.
        
        Test (Unit Tests)
        -----------------
        
        The tests are done through Travis-CI already.
        
        However, running the full test within your local environment is just
        three lines, provided that you have Redis installed and running:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            $ pip install -r test_requirements.txt
            $ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=tidehunter

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.1.9 (2013-12-24)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  ``PyCurl`` and ``Redis`` Python libraries bumped to the latest
           versions.
        -  ``Queue`` now is **almost** Python Queue compatible (in a complaint
           free fashion), with the exception of ``Queue.full`` which always
           returns ``False``; ``Queue.task_done`` and ``Queue.join`` do nothing.
        -  NEW: Both ``Queue`` and ``StateCounter`` now have a ``clear`` method
           which performs a Redis ``DEL`` command on the said key and
           reinitialize based on each class's ``initialize`` method.
        
        0.1.8 (2013-10-02)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Added alias methods ``put_nowait()`` and ``get_nowait()`` and other
           place holders to map the Python built-in Queue interfaces.
        -  Added ``rstgen`` shell script for Markdown to reStructuredText. To
           use, run ``$ source rstgen`` in the root folder.
        -  Credentials involved in unit tests and demo are now using environment
           variables.
        
        0.1.7 (2013-07-22)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Massive update to README.rst
        -  Fixed PyPi rendering of long description.
        
        0.1.5 (2013-07-22)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  NEW: ``Hunter.tide_on()`` now accepts an optional limit parameter for
           on the fly limit adjustment. The adjustment is not permanent, meaning
           if you want to reuse the same Hunter object, the old limit (or
           default None) is in effect.
        -  Fixed a potential issue of Hunter puts in more records than desired
           limit.
        -  Added temp Basic Auth test case (no stream, need to find a better
           source).
        
        0.1.3 (2013-07-13)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Use the great httpbin.org (by Kenneth Reitz) for unit test now.
        -  Auth (oauth or basic) is no longer required, as long as the target
           stream server supports access without auth.
        
        0.1.2 (2013-07-12)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Include CHANGES (changelog) to be shown on PyPi.
        -  Use with statement to open files for setup.py.
        -  Added the first
           `demo <https://github.com/amoa/tidehunter/tree/master/demo>`__.
        
        0.1.1 (2013-07-12)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Clean up setup.py to ensure requirements are installed/updated.
        
        0.1.0 (2013-07-12)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
