.SH NAME
assemble \- Assembles a configuration file from fragments
.\" ------ DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Assembles a configuration file from fragments. Often a particular program will take a single configuration file and does not support a \fCconf.d\fR style structure where it is easy to build up the configuration from multiple sources. \fIassemble\fR will take a directory of files that can be local or have already been transferred to the system, and concatenate them together to produce a destination file. Files are assembled in string sorting order. Puppet calls this idea \fIfragments\fR. 
.\" ------ OPTIONS

.SH OPTIONS
   
.IP backup
Create a backup file (if \fCyes\fR), including the timestamp information so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
.IR Choices :
yes,no. (default: no)   
.IP delimiter
A delimiter to seperate the file contents.(Added in Ansible version 1.4.)
   
.IP dest
A file to create using the concatenation of all of the source files.(required)   
.IP others
all arguments accepted by the \fIfile\fR module also work here   
.IP regexp
Assemble files only if \fCregex\fR matches the filename. If not set, all files are assembled. All "" (backslash) must be escaped as "\\" to comply yaml syntax. Uses Python regular expressions; see \fIhttp://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html\fR.   
.IP remote_src
If False, it will search for src at originating/master machine, if True it will go to the remote/target machine for the src. Default is True.
.IR Choices :
True,False. (default: True)(Added in Ansible version 1.4.)
   
.IP src
An already existing directory full of source files.(required).\"
