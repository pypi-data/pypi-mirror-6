This version of nodebox-color can optionally load color XML
from a zip file instead of a folder.

This makes installation faster and saves a little space.

It will search for both and load an XML from the first it finds.


When editing the colors it may be easiest to use straight XML files.


Note - the root of the zip is the same name as the file, e.g. 'aggregated'.
