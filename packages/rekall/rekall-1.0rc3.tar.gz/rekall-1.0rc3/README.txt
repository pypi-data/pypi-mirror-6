Rekall Memory Forensic Framework
================================

The Rekall Framework is a completely open collection of tools, implemented in
Python under the GNU General Public License, for the extraction of digital
artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.  The extraction techniques are
performed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer
visibilty into the runtime state of the system. The framework is intended to
introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated with extracting
digital artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide a platform for
further work into this exciting area of research.

The Rekall distribution is available from:
https://code.google.com/p/rekall/

Rekall should run on any platform that supports
Python (http://www.python.org)

Rekall supports investigations of the following x86 bit memory images:

* Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and 3
* Microsoft Windows 7 Service Pack 0 and 1
* Linux Kernels 2.6.24 to 3.10.
* OSX 10.6-10.8.

Rekall also provides a complete memory sample acquisition capability for all
major operating systems (see the tools directory).

Quick start
===========

Rekall is available as a python package installable via the pip package
manager. Simply type (for example on Linux):

sudo pip install rekall

On OSX you might need to specificially allow pre-release software to be included
(until Rekall makes a major stable release):

sudo pip install --pre rekall

To have all the dependencies installed. You still need to have python and pip
installed first.

To be able to run the ipython notebook, the following are also required:

pip install Jinja2 MarkupSafe Pygments astroid pyzmq tornado wsgiref

For windows, Rekall is also available as a self contained windows installer
package. Please check the download page for the most appropriate installer to
use (http://downloads.rekall.googlecode.com/git/index.html)
