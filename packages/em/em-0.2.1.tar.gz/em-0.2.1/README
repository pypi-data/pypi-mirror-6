                                //  em  //

                     emphasize expressions in stdout


    ~ What is Em?

      Em is a terminal tool that prints FILE(s), or standard input to
      standard output and highlights the expressions that are matched
      the PATTERN.

      The expression will be highlighted iff stdout refers to the tty
      and that tty is ANSI-compatible.


    ~ Why the name Em?

      The name is an abbreviation of emphasize, a synonym of highlight.
      BTW, it's easy to write and it's easy to remember since HTML has
      <em> tag with similar meaning.


    ~ Requirements?

      The terminal must be ANSI-compatible. This criterion is met by
      most popular terminal emulators on Linux, Unix and MacOS.


    ~ How to install?

        $ (sudo) pip install em


    ~ How to use?

      The most practical usecase for me:

        $ tail -f /path/to/log | em "ERROR" red | em "WARNING" yellow
