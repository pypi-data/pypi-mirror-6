Description: "Quickstart"
        ------------
        
        A better place to start might be http://telehash.org
        
        This will break. You were warned. :)
        
        If you aren't already using virtualenvs, it is highly recommended for
        playing with plinth: http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/
        
        You will also need libevent (for gevent) which should be easily found in
        most Linux distributions, or installed on Mac OS X from http://brew.sh/
        
        Next you'll want to `mkdir $HOME/.plinth` and put in a seeds.json which
        you can find at: https://github.com/telehash/thjs/blob/master/seeds.json
        
        Now, from within your virtualenv:
        
        | $ pip install plinth
        | $ examples/seed.py -v
        
        Now behold as your terminal fills with indecipherable debug details.
