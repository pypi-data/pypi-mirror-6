0.7:
    - Fixed: a busy leader which doesn't respond to a ping on a timely fashion was not handled correctly.


0.6:
    - NEW: new types of counters MaxWindowCounter, MinWindowCounter
    - IMPORTANT: changes in package structure, counters module split int sub modules. Backward compatible as long as no
      internals were used.
    - Fixed: removing a counter by name caused an exception
    - Fixed: too short queue on multi process server caused pycounters to fail if used on >~10 processes
    - Fixed: starting up a new process in a multi-process auto election setup caused JSON reporter to output an empty
      file (which will then be updated in the next cycle)

0.5:
    - Fixed - locking issue with JSON output files
    - Fixed - EventCounter did not respond to events keyword argument
