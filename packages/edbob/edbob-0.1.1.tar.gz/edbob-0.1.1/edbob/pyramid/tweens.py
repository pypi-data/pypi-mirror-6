    Produces a tween which will convert ``sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError``
    instances (caused by database server restart) into a retryable
    ``transaction.interfaces.TransientError`` instance, so that a second
    attempt may be made to connect to the database before really giving up.

    .. note::
       This tween alone is not enough to cause the transaction to be retried;
       it only marks the error as being *retryable*.  If you wish more than one
       attempt to be made, you must define the ``tm.attempts`` setting within
       your Pyramid app configuration.  See `Retrying
       <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_tm/en/latest/#retrying>`_
       for more information.
