        What is Tuskar?
        ---------------
        Tuskar gives administrators the ability to control how and where
        OpenStack services are deployed across the datacenter. Using Tuskar,
        administrators divide hardware into "resource classes" that allow
        predictable elastic scaling as cloud demands grow. This resource
        orchestration allows Tuskar users to ensure SLAs, improve performance,
        and maximize utilization across the datacenter.
        
        Tuskar services are available via a RESTful API and management console
        through which administrators are able to classify their hardware and
        define their datacenters. In addition, Tuskar components provide
        administrators with performance monitoring, health statistics, and
        usage metrics, aiding in capacity planning and hardware procurement
        decisions.
