.. note:: This is a "Release Fix" for a **very old** version of circuits that the `Zato <https://zato.io/>`_ project
          has asked for. See: `Issue #62 <https://bitbucket.org/circuits/circuits/issue/62/installing-circuits-15-install-1515>`_

.. warning:: Please **DO NOT** use this release if you are not using `Zato <https://zato.io/>`_. circuits 1.x and 2.x are considered retired
             and are no longer supported. For the latest version of circuits see: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/circuits


Overview
--------

circuits is a **Lightweight** **Event** driven and **Asynchronous**
**Application Framework** for the `Python Programming Language`_
with a strong **Component** Architecture.

circuits also includes a lightweight, high performance and scalable
HTTP/WSGI web server as well as various I/O and Networking components.

To take full advantage of circuits and it's architecture, circuits
requires that your application be designed in terms of components
and their interactions (*events*) with each other. An application
written using the circuits application framework is maintainable,
scalable and easy to develop.

The circuits framework has a certain elegance making it a rather
attracting feature. New features are built into the framework with
this in mind and circuits "eats it's own dog food" by having a
feature-rich library of components built atop the core components.

Features
--------

- event driven
- concurrency support
- compnoent archiecture
- asynchronous I/O components
- no required external dependencies
- full featured web framework (circuits.web)


Requirements
------------

circuits has no dependencies beyond the `Python Standard Library`_.

Some dependencies should be optionally installed if deployed on a Python-2.5
environment such as `processing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing/>`_
for multiprocessing concurrency support and for JSON support the
`simplejson <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/>`_ package.


Installation
------------

The simplest and recommended way to install circuits is with pip.
You may install the latest stable release from PyPI with pip::

    > pip install circuits

If you do not have pip, you may use easy_install::

    > easy_install circuits

Alternatively, you may download the source package from the
`circuits Page on PyPI`_ or the `circuits Downloads page`_ on the
`circuits Website`_; extract it and install using::

    > python setup.py install

Feedback
--------

I welcome any questions or feedback about bugs and suggestions on how to 
improve circuits. Let me know what you think about circuits. I am on twitter 
`@therealprologic <http://twitter.com/therealprologic>`_.

Do you have suggestions for improvement? Then please `Create an Issue`_
with details of what you would like to see. I'll take a look at it and
work with you to either incorporate the idea or find a better solution.


Community
---------

There is also a small community of circuits enthusiasts that you may
find on the `circuits IRC Channel`_ and the `circuits Mailing List`_.
