Description: Eggsac: Package Python applications in a virtualenv for deployment.
        
        Eggsac takes a Python application,
        installs it and all of its dependencies into a *relocatable* virtualenv_,
        and wraps it all up in a ready-to-run tarball, zipfile, or Debian package,
        which can be deployed on other machines.
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        Installing Python applications can be slow.
        Compiling Python modules into bytecode,
        compiling C extensions into shared libraries,
        building eggs,
        downloading a cascade of dependencies from the `Python Package Index`_
        (assuming PyPI is available)â€”\
        all of this can take several minutes for a large application.
        Even if you have an internal PyPI mirror and use binary eggs for the dependencies,
        it can still take a long time to roll the application out to a server farm.
        
        Eggsac does all of this effort as part of your build process,
        leaving you with a single ready-to-run file to deploy to your servers.
        
        Caveat: your build machine has to be running the same operating system
        as your application servers, but this is a common requirement.
