Description: =========
        Regexlint
        =========
        
        Regexlint will examine all regular expressions in an importable Pygments
        lexer, and report things that are probably not doing what you think they're
        doing.  For example, patterns like this (which will only match the first)::
        
            (else|elseif)
        
        It can also warn about a few syntax problems, for example this has two
        problems -- the ``\s+`` outside the groups, and not enough actions in bygroups
        (this one needs two in the args to bygroups)::
        
            (r'(foo)\s+(bar)', bygroups(Blah)),
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            make demo
                or
            regexlint pygments.lexers.web:HtmlLexer
                or
            python2 regexlint/cmdline.py pygments.lexers.web
        
        
        Todo
        ====
        
        * Figure out which phase should remove unnecessary backslashes
        * Write the alternation expander, so that ([ax]|a[bc]) fails the alternation
          order checks
        * Make more general than just for Pygments
