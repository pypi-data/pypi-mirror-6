mezzanine-grappelli
===================

Mezzanine-Grappelli makes Mezzanine â™¥ Grappelli.

For compatibility reasons, Mezzanine uses forks of Grappelli and Filebrowser,
known as grappelli-safe and filebrowser-safe.

You want the awesomeness of Mezzanine with the sweetness of the latest
Grappelli version? This application does exactly that: it allows you to use the
full power of the latest vanilla versions of both Grappelli and Filebrowser in
your Mezzanine projects.

Installation
============

First, install mezzanine-grappelli with pip (this will automatically install
Grappelli and Filebrowser as well)::

    pip install mezzanine-grappelli

In your ``settings.py`` file, adapt the value of
``PACKAGE_NAME_FILEBROWSER`` and ``PACKAGE_NAME_GRAPPELLI``::

    PACKAGE_NAME_FILEBROWSER = "filebrowser"
    PACKAGE_NAME_GRAPPELLI = "grappelli"

Still in your ``settings.py`` file, add mezzanine_grappelli, grappelli and
filebrowser to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` (make sure they appear before any
mezzanine app)::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        "mezzanine_grappelli",
        PACKAGE_NAME_GRAPPELLI,
        PACKAGE_NAME_FILEBROWSER,
        ...
    )

Add Grappelli URLs to your ``urls.py`` file::

    urlpatterns += patterns("",
        ...
        ("^grappelli/", include("grappelli.urls")),
        ...
    )

You're done!

Rough edges
===========

The project still being in its early days, it has a few rough edges you should
be aware of.

TabularDynamicInlineAdmin doesn't work
--------------------------------------

Use classic Django ``TabularInline`` instead.

Filebrowser error: "Error finding Upload-Folder (site.storage.location + site.directory). Maybe it does not exist?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's because Filebrowser doesn't automatically create the uploads directory,
so just create the ``MEDIA_ROOT + 'uploads/'`` directory

FileField doesn't work
----------------------

When using ``FileField`` fields you need to put the ``format`` in lowercase
(ie.  "image" instead of "Image") otherwise you'll get a Filebrowser exception.
That's especially true for already defined Mezzanine models (such as the
``BlogPost`` model). To fix the issue for already-defined Mezzanine models, you
can add the following to your settings file::

    FILEBROWSER_SELECT_FORMATS = {
        'File': ['Folder', 'Image', 'Document', 'Video', 'Audio'],
        'Document': ['Document'],
        'Media': ['Video', 'Audio'],
        'Image': ['Image'],
        'image': ['Image'],
    }

TODO
====

* Make ``TabularDynamicInlineAdmin`` work or at least fall back to a usable
  solution
