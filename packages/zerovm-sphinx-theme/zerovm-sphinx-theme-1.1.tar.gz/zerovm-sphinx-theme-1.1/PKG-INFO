Description: ZeroVM Theme for Sphinx
        =======================
        
        This package bundles the ZeroVM_ theme for Sphinx_.
        
        Install the package and add this to your ``conf.py``::
        
            import zerovm_sphinx_theme
            html_theme_path = [zerovm_sphinx_theme.theme_path]
            html_theme = 'zerovm'
