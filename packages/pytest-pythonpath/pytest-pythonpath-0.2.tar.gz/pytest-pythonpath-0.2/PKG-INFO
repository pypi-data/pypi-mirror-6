Description: pytest-pythonpath
        =================
        
        This is a py.test plugin for adding to the PYTHONPATH from the pytests.ini file before tests run.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install with pip::
        
            pip install pytest-pythonpath
        
        Uninstall with pip::
        
            pip uninstall pytest-pythonpath
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add a line in your pytest.ini file with a key of `python_paths` and provide a space seperated list of paths
        you want added to the PYTHONPATH before any tests run:
        
            [pytest]
            python_paths = your/path/apps your/path/libs
        
        Once this is added to your pytest.ini, you can use the py.test command as you normally would.
