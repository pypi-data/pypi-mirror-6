Libtfr is a library for calculating multi-taper time-frequency reassignment (TFR) spectrograms. Time-frequency reassignment is a method that makes use of the instantaneous frequency and phase values in a spectrogram to 'deconvolve' the image, and can yield substantially sharper spectrograms with better signal-noise resolution than conventional windowed spectrograms (i.e. short-time Fourier transforms) or multi-taper spectrograms (using the discrete prolate spherical sequences).

The library will also calculate conventional windowed spectrograms and multitaper spectrograms.

## Requirements

* FFTW, version 3.x: <http://www.fftw.org>. TFR spectrograms require 3 FFT transforms per taper, so most of the computational time will be spent computing FFTs. FFTW is fast, flexible, and portable.

* LAPACK: <http://www.netlib.org/lapack>. Conventional multitaper spectrograms use discrete prolate spherical sequences as tapers. My algorithm for generating the tapers uses the LAPACK functions *dsterf* and *dgtsv*. For OS X users, LAPACK is included with the system; Linux and Windows users will probably have to install a package.

* Scons: <http://www.scons.org>. *scons* is a much-improved alternative to Make/Autoconf. A Makefile is included in the distribution but may require some fiddling to work.

* (optional) Python, version 2.4+, with numpy 1.3+

* (optional) MATLAB, R14 or later. The MATLAB interface has not been extensively tested, as I generally prefer to use Python. If anyone is interested in testing and maintaining this part of the code please contact me.

## Build/Installation

### Library

It may be necessary to edit the SConstruct file to make sure it points to the correct LAPACK libraries.

    scons lib

To install the libraries and header (default to /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include):

    scons install

A small test program, *test_tfr*, may be built with `scons test`. The program generates a signal with sinusoidally modulated frequency and then calculates a multitaper PSD, a multitaper spectrogram, and a time-frequency reassigned spectrogram. The results are output in ASCII format to `tfr_in.dat`, `tfr_out_psd.dat`, `tfr_out_mtm.dat`, and `tfr_out_tfr.dat`.

### Python package

It is not necessary to build the library in the previous step as Python's distribution tool will do this on its own.

    python setup.py install

The python interface can be tested with the script `test_tfr.py`, which does much the same as the test program for the library, but adds some noise to the signal as well.

### MATLAB mex file:

    scons mex

Copy the mex file (the extension will depend on your platform) and the associated mfile (tfrspec.m) to a location in your MATLAB path.

## Use

### C/C++

```c
int N = 256;
int Np = 201;
int step = 10;
int k = 6;
double tm = 6.0;

// load signal with npoints frames
double *sig = ...

int l = (npoints - Np + 1) / step;
double *specgram = (double*)calloc(l * (N/2+1), sizeof(double));
mfft *mtmh = mtm_init_herm(N, Np, k, tm);
tfr_spec(mtmh, specgram, sig, npoints, -1, step, 0.01, 5, 0, NULL);

```

### Python

```python
import libtfr
nfft = 256
Np = 201
shift = 10
K = 6
tm = 6.0
flock = 0.01,
tlock = 5,

# load signal of dimension (npoints,)
signal = ...
S = libtfr.tfr_spec(signal, nfft, shift, Np, K, tm, flock, tlock)

```

The C header `tfr.h` and python module `libtfr.py` are both extensively documented.

## Algorithm and usage notes

The software was assembled from various MATLAB sources, including the time-frequency toolkit, Xiao and Flandrin's work on multitaper reassignment, and code from Gardner and Magnasco.

The basic principle is to use reassignment to increase the precision of the time-frequency localization, essentially by deconvolving the spectrogram with the TF representation of the window, recovering the center of mass of the spectrotemporal energy. Reassigned TFRs typically show a 'froth' for noise, and strong narrow lines for coherent signals like pure tones, chirps, and so forth. The use of multiple tapers reinforces the coherent signals while averaging out the froth, giving a very clean spectrogram with optimal precision and resolution properties.

Gardner & Magnasco calculate reassignment based on a different algorithm from Xiao and Flandrin. The latter involves 3 different FFT operations on the signal windowed with the hermitian taper *h(t)*, its derivative *h'(t)*, and its time product *t Ã— h(t)*. The G&M algorithm only uses two FFTs, on the signal windowed with a Gaussian and its time derivative. If I understand their methods correctly, however, this derivation is based on properties of the fourier transform of the gaussian, and isn't appropriate for window functions based on the Hermitian tapers, which have more optimal distribution of energy over the TF plane (i.e., it takes fewer Hermitian tapers than Gaussian tapers to achieve the same quality spectrogram)

Therefore, the algorithm is mostly from X&F, though I include time and frequency locking parameters from G&M, which specify how far energy is allowed to be reassigned in the TF plane. Large displacements generally arise from numerical errors, so this helps to sharpen the lines somewhat. I also included the time/frequency interpolation from , which can be used to get higher precision (at the expense of less averaging) from smaller analysis windows.

Some fiddling with parameters is necessary to get the best spectrograms from a given sort of signal. Like the window size in an STFT, the taper parameters control the time-frequency resolution. However, in the reassignment spectrogram the precision (i.e. localization) is not affected by the taper size, so the effects of taper size will generally only be seen when two coherent signals are close to each other in time or frequency. `Nh` controls the size of the tapers; one can also adjust `tm`, the time support of the tapers, but depending on the number of tapers used, this shouldn't get a whole lot smaller than 5. Increased values of `Nh` result in improved narrowband resolution (i.e. between pure tones) but closely spaced clicks can become smeared. Decreasing `Nh` increases the resolution between broadband components (i.e. clicks) but smears closely spaced narrowband components. The effect of smearing can be ameliorated to some extent by adjusting the frequency/time locking parameters.

The frequency zoom parameter can be used to speed up calculation quite a bit. Since calculating the multitaper reassigned spectrogram takes 3xNtapers FFT operations, smaller FFTs are generally better. The spectrogram can then be binned at a finer resolution during reassignment. These two sets of parameters should generate fairly similar results:

    nfft=512, shift=10, tm=6, Nh=257, zoomf=1, zoomt=1 (default)
    nfft=256, shift=10, tm=6, Nh=257, zoomf=2, zoomt=1

Increasing the order generally reduces the background 'froth', but interference between closely spaced components may increase.

Additional improvements in resolution may be achievable averaging across different window sizes, or by using other averaging methods (i.e. as in Xiao and Flandrin)
