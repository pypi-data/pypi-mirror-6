Description: ==============
            patois
        ==============
        
        ``patois`` is an MIT-licensed compatibility library designed to smooth
        over differences in various Python VMs,
        e.g., CPython vs. Jython vs. PyPy vs. IronPython. It provides utility
        functions with the goal of making it easier to write Python code that is
        compatible with all the major Python VMs. See the documentation for more
        information on what is provided.
        
        ``patois`` supports Python 2.7, because it is the newest Python that is
        widely supported by the major VMs.
        
        Inspiration
        -----------
        
        This package was inspired by `Six`_.
        
        .. _Six: http://pythonhosted.org/six/
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install ``patois``, simply::
        
            $ pip install patois
        
        Or, if you absolutely must::
        
            $ easy_install patois
        
        But, you really shouldn't do that.
        
        If you want to vendor the lib for some reason, it's a single file, so just drop
        it into your project.
