Development miscellany
======================

Build framework
---------------

'make' should build everything, including tests and "development" code.

Coding standards
----------------

For C++, we use `Todd Hoff's coding standard
<http://www.possibility.com/Cpp/CppCodingStandard.html>`__, and
`astyle -A10 / "One True Brace Style"
<http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html>`__ indentation and
bracing.  Note: @CTB needs emacs settings that work for this.

Vim users may want to set the ARTISTIC_STYLE_OPTIONS shell variable to "-A10"
and running ```:%!astyle``` to reformat. The four space indentation can be set with::

	set expandtab
	set shiftwidth=4
	set softtabstop=4

For Python, `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ is our
standard. The ```pep8``` and ```autopep8``` Makefile targets are helpful. 

Code Review Checklist
---------------------

Copy and paste the following into a pull-request when it is ready for review::
   
   - [ ] Is it mergable
   - [ ] Did it pass the tests?
   - [ ] If it introduce new functionality in scripts/ is it tested?
     Check for code coverage.
   - [ ] Is it well formatted? Look at `pep8`/`pylint`, `cppcheck`, and
     `make doc` output. Use `autopep8` and `astyle -A10` if needed. 
   - [ ] Is it documented in the Changelog?

git and github strategies
-------------------------

Still in the works, but read `this
<http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__.

Make a branch on ged-lab (preferred so others can contribute) or fork the
repository and make a branch there.

Each piece or fix you are working on should have its own branch; make a pull-
request to ged-lab/master to aid in code review, testing, and feedback.

If you want your code integrated then it needs to be mergable

Example pull request update using the command line:

1. Clone the source of the pull request (if needed)
```git clone git@github.com:mr-c/khmer.git```
2. Checkout the source branch of the pull request
```git checkout my-pull-request```
3. Pull in the destination of the pull request and resolve any conflicts.
```git pull git@github.com:ged-lab/khmer.git master```
4. Push your update to the source of the pull request
```git push```
5. Jenkins will automatically attempt to build and test your pull requests



#changes need to be documented in the Changelog

Testing
-------

setup.py nosetest is the canonical way to run the tests.  This is what
'make test' does.

# this is configured via setup.cfg in the nosetest stanza

Code coverage
-------------

Jenkins calculates code coverage for every build. Navigate to the results from
the master node first to view the coverage information.

Code coverage should never go down and new functionality needs to be tested.

Pipelines
---------

All khmer scripts used by a published recommended analysis pipeline must be
included in scripts/ and meet the standards therein implied.

Command line scripts
--------------------

Python command-line scripts should use '-' instead of '_' in the name.
(Only filenames containing code for import imported should use _.)

Please follow the command-line conventions used under scripts/.  This
includes most especially standardization of '-x' to be hash table size,
'-N' to be number of hash tables, and '-k' to always refer to the
k-mer size.

Command line thoughts:

   If a filename is required, typically UNIX commands don't use a flag to
   specify it.

   Also, positional arguments typically aren't used with multiple files.

   CTB's overall philosophy is that new files, with new names, should
   be created as the result of filtering etc.; this allows easy
   chaining of commands.  We're thinking about how best to allow
   override of this, e.g. ::

      filter-abund.py <kh file> <filename> [ -o <filename.keep> ]

----

All code in scripts/ must have automated tests; see tests/test_scripts.py.
Otherwise it belongs in sandbox/.

When files are overwritten, they should only be opened to be overwritten
after the input files have been shown to exist.  That prevents stupid
command like mistakes from trashing important files.

It would be nice to allow piping from one command to another where possible.
But this seems complicated.

CTB: should we squash output files (overwrite them if they exist), or not?
So far, leaning towards 'not', as that way no one is surprised and loses
their data.

Python / C integration
----------------------

The Python extension that wraps the C++ core of khmer lives in
khmer/_khmermodule.CC

This wrapper code is tedious and annoying so we use a static analysis tool to
check for correctness.

https://gcc-python-plugin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cpychecker.html

Developers using Ubuntu Precise will want to install the gcc-4.6-plugin-dev package

Example usage: ::

<<<<<<< HEAD
	CC="/home/mcrusoe/src/gcc-plugin-python/gcc-python-plugin/gcc-with-cpychecker
	--maxtrans=512" python setup.py build_ext 2>&1 | less
=======
  CC="/home/mcrusoe/src/gcc-plugin-python/gcc-python-plugin/gcc-with-cpychecker --maxtrans=512" python setup.py build_ext 2>&1 | less
>>>>>>> 6ef48af354ce421c656225cc5844bf5c995018b0

False positives abound: ignore errors about the C++ standard library. This tool
is primarily useful for reference count checking, error-handling checking, and
format string checking.

Errors to ignore: "Unhandled Python exception raised calling 'execute' method",
"AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'file'"

Warnings to address: ::

	khmer/_khmermodule.cc:3109:1: note: this function is too complicated for the
	reference-count checker to fully analyze: not all paths were analyze

<<<<<<< HEAD
Adjust --maxtrans and re-run. ::

	khmer/_khmermodule.cc:2191:61: warning: Mismatching type in call to
	Py_BuildValue with format code "i" [enabled by default]
	  argument 2 ("D.68937") had type
	    "long long unsigned int"
	  but was expecting
	    "int"
	  for format code "i"
=======
Adjust --maxtrans and re-run::

  khmer/_khmermodule.cc:2191:61: warning: Mismatching type in call to

See below for a format string cheatsheet One also benefits by matching C type
with the function signature used later. 

"I" for unsinged int
"K" for unsigned long long a.k.a khmer::HashIntoType.

Upstream sources
----------------

ez_setup.py is from https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/

Before major releases it should be examined to see if there is a new version
