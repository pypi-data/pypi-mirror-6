Description: django-socialshareprivacy
        =========================
        
        This Django applcation makes the jQuery Plug-In socialshareprivacy from heise.de available in django templates.
        The plugin will show disabled buttons for the share adn tweet buttons, these disabled buttons are hosted locally. If the user wants to share or tweet he has to first click the disabled button which will then load the real button from facebook, G+ or Twitter. A second click on the buttons will then actually share the page. This basically means that the possibility of sharing is available but until the user interacts with the buttons no data is transmitted to the social networks.
        
        The home of the jQuery plugin is http://www.heise.de/extras/socialshareprivacy/.
        
        This application uses the same version numbers as the jQuery plugin and appends a third digit to allow for application releases independently of the plugin.
