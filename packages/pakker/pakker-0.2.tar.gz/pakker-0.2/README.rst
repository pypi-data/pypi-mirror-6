pakker
======

pakker is a Python library that helps dealing with data that was
serialized in language-specific serialization formats. In its current
state, it only implements (part of) PHP's ``serialize`` and
``unserialize`` functions.


Supported Python versions
=========================

Works with Python 2.6 up to Python 3.3.

.. note::

   As it makes use of the CPython C API, pakker is probably only
   useful when used on top of CPython.
