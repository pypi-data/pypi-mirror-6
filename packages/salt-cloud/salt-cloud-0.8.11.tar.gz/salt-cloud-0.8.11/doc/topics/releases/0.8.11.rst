Salt Cloud 0.8.11 Release Notes
===============================

Welcome to 0.8.11! This is a bugfix release for 0.8.10, which contained some
issues concerning EC2. The entire repository has been merged upstream into the
main Salt repository. All future changes will be found there, and any future
issues and pull requests need to be filed there:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt

Existing issues in the Salt Cloud issue tracker will remain there, and efforts
to close standing issues there will continue. We will not, however, be able to
merge additional pull requests made against the old salt-cloud repository.
