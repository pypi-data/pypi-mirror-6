"""
Chronic is a module designed to do simple profiling of your python code while
giving you full control of the granularity of measurement.  It maintains the
hierarchy of the call tree, but only at the levels you care about.  The timing
results can easily be captured as JSON and logged for analysis in postgres or
mongodb.

You may use the @time decorator or the Timer context manager:

>>> @time
>>> def func():
>>>     with Timer('bar'):
>>>         pass
>>> func()
>>> timings
{
    'func': {
        'total_elapsed': 38.5,
        'count': 1,
        'average_elapsed': 38.5
        'timings': {
            'bar': {
                'total_elapsed': 20.52,
                'count': 1
                'average_elapsed': 20.52
            }
        }
    }
}
