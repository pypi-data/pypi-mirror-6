        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.behavior.localregistry`` to the
           list of eggs to install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.behavior.localregistry
        
        #. If you are using Plone 4.1 you may need to extend a Dexterity known good
           set (KGS) to make sure that you get the right versions of the packages that
           make up Dexterity::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                https://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.2.1?plone=4.1.6
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.behavior.localregistry`` and click the
        'Activate' button.
        
        .. Note::
            You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
            in order to see the effects of the product installation.

        1.0b2 (2014-03-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix package credits.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Pillow was removed as a package dependency.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Allow objects with this behavior applied to be renamed.  Previously, this
          failed with a KeyError as the underlying registry needed to be reconfigured
          for a new path.
