        # Introduction
        
        Evernote is a wonderful application. However, it's GUI-based, which is not a 
        problem on Windows, but makes Linux console fans pain. As a proprietary 
        software, it's not open enough to add new features, for example, add a console
        wrapper on it. So after half-a-year running Evernote Windows in wine on my
        Linux laptop, I wrote this "Donno" which has similiar features of Evernote, but
        is completely console thing. Now I imported all my notes to this app, and have 
        a happy life ...
