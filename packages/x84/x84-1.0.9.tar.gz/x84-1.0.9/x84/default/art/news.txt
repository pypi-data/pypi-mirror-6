Release 1.0.5 is now on pypi. This release includes "dropfile" and concise dosemu support. An example lord.py door is used and hosted on 1984.ws.

I'd also like to tell you about a new python 3.3 telnet API:

  |11https://github.com/jquast/telnetlib3

This may find its way back into x/84 in some coming years, after Guido's "tulip" module is released as a part of python 3.4.

It features lightning-fast connect-time negotiation through the use of "futures", and all three line input modes: local line editing (half-duplex), remote line editing, and "kludge" mode, which is used here on x/84 and other bbs systems. It supports the telnet CHARSET option and on-the-fly changes of any encoding and binary mode bi-directionally (utf-8 input, cp437 output, for example). This is also complaint with *all* telnet clients, including MUD clients, and provides lightning-faster-than-ssh remote line editing for most unix telnet clients.

I've been contributing significant terminal fixes and enhancements upstream to the python 'blessings' project. They should become apart of a blessings v1.6 release. With these features, much of the x/84 codebase may be stripped and cleaned up, and several improvements to general readability.

I wrote a pong game, and another "Newton's Nightmare" for keyboard and mouse test input. The mousewheel can be used to move the Pong paddle, and who knows, maybe we'll have 2-player Pong on the BBS soon :-)

x/84 version 1.0.4 has been released to pypi, to install:

   $ |11pip install x84

To upgrade:

   $ |11pip install --upgrade x84

This release improves editing and message reading capabilities. You may have noticed the |10Colors|07, which are safe to use in pager and lightbars. If you need to escape, use another pipe, '||13'. The |14Ansi|07 class now provides an additional method, |14encode_pipe|07, to accompany the previously existing method, |14decode_pipe|07.
