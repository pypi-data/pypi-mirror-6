Description: silva.security.addable
        **********************
        
        This small Silva extension provides an interface in SMI to manage
        which roles have the right to add which content type.
        
        It's ensure as well that current permissions are set correctly
        according the Silva logic.
        
        It requires at least Silva 2.0.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        If you installed Silva using buildout, by getting one from the `Infrae
        SVN`_ repository, or creating one using `Paster`_, you should edit your
        buildout configuration file ``buildout.cfg`` to add or edit the
        following section::
        
          [instance]
        
          eggs +=
                silva.security.addables
        
          zcml += 
                silva.security.addables
        
        If the section ``instance`` wasn't already in the configuration file,
        pay attention to re-copy values for ``eggs`` and ``zcml`` from the
        profile you use.
        
        After you can restart buildout::
        
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        
        If you don't use buildout, you can install this extension using
        ``easy_install``, and after create a file called
        ``silva.security.addables-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  This file will
        responsible to load the extension and should only contain this::
        
          <include package="silva.security.addables" />
