Description: # filedb
        Create a file that pretends to be a MongoDB collection. If you try 
        to open the file, it will JSONify the collection and dump it back to you.
        
        ## Why?
        Because our enterprise database is file based, but our cloud based database
        isn't.
        
        ## ...no really why?
        Files are simpler and don't break. The database operations we need to perform
        aren't complicated and don't require high performance. By using files there
        isn't a database that can fail. There's the added benefit that if customers want
        to use different types of databases for distributed systems, we can plug into 
        any of them using a `filedb` (we just have to make something that dumps out JSON
        .
        
        ## Quickstart
        
        #### Install FUSE
        Make sure you have [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) installed.
        
        - [FUSE for OSX](http://osxfuse.github.io/)
        - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install g++ libfuse-dev`
        
        #### Get mongo running
        And you'll need a collection with some data in it.
        ```bash
        $ mongod
        ```
        
        ```bash
        $ mongo
        > use test
        > db.people.insert({"username": "greg"})
        > db.people.insert({"username": "phil"})
        > db.people.insert({"username": "bob"})
        > db.people.insert({"username": "samantha"})
        ```
        
        #### Install filedb
        ```bash
        $ pip install filedb
        ```
        
        #### Running via python
        ```bash
        $ filedb /tmp/tutorial/mnt/ mongodb://localhost:27017/test people
        ```
        
        #### Open the file
        ```bash
        $ cat /tmp/tutorial/mnt/db
        [{ "_id": "52f104a7a0fb769e0cd0d1d4", "username": "greg" }
        { "_id": "52f104a9a0fb769e0cd0d1d5", "username": "phil" }
        { "_id": "52f104aca0fb769e0cd0d1d6", "username": "bob" }
        { "_id": "52f104aea0fb769e0cd0d1d7", "username": "samantha" }]
        ```
        
        ## Running as a service
        Upstart job.
        ```bash
        $ sudo cp -R overlay/* /
        $ sudo start filedb
        ```
