        Installation
        ============
        
        You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the
        package. If you just want to use the Postmaster Python bindings, you
        should run::
        
            easy_install postmaster
        
        See http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html for instructions
        on installing pip. If you are on a system with easy_install but not
        pip, you can use easy_install instead. If you're not using virtualenv,
        you may have to prefix those commands with `sudo`. You can learn more
        about virtualenv at http://www.virtualenv.org/
        
        To install from source, run::
        
            python setup.py install
