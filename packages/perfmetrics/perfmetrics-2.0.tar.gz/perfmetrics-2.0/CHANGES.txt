CHANGES
=======

2.0 (2013-12-10)
----------------

- Added the @MetricMod decorator, which changes the name of metrics in
  a given context. For example, "@MetricMod('xyz.%s')" adds a prefix.

- Removed the "gauge suffix" feature. It was unnecessarily confusing.

- Timing metrics produced by "@metric", "@metricmethod", and "@Metric"
  now have a ".t" suffix by default to avoid naming conflicts.

----------------

- Added 'perfmetrics.tween' and 'perfmetrics.wsgi' stats for measuring
  request timing and counts.

0.9.5 (2012-09-22)
------------------

- Added an optional Pyramid tween and a similar WSGI filter app
  that sets up the Statsd client for each request.

0.9.4 (2012-09-08)
------------------

- Optimized the use of reduced sample rates.

0.9.3 (2012-09-08)
