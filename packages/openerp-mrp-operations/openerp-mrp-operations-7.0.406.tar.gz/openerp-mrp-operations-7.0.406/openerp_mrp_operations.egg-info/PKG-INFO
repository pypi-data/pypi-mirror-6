Description: 
        
        This module adds state, date_start, date_stop in manufacturing order operation lines (in the 'Work Orders' tab).
        ================================================================================================================
        
        Status: draft, confirm, done, cancel
        When finishing/confirming, cancelling manufacturing orders set all state lines
        to the according state.
        
        Create menus:
        -------------
            **Manufacturing** > **Manufacturing** > **Work Orders**
        
        Which is a view on 'Work Orders' lines in manufacturing order.
        
        Add buttons in the form view of manufacturing order under workorders tab:
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
            * start (set state to confirm), set date_start
            * done (set state to done), set date_stop
            * set to draft (set state to draft)
            * cancel set state to cancel
        
        When the manufacturing order becomes 'ready to produce', operations must
        become 'confirmed'. When the manufacturing order is done, all operations
        must become done.
        
        The field 'Working Hours' is the delay(stop date - start date).
        So, that we can compare the theoretic delay and real delay.
