Computing resource and workflow selection
=========================================

When the GUI is started a window invites you to chose a computing resource 
among the configured ones (see :ref:`client_configuration`) and to enter 
authentication information if necessary. 

If several computing resources are configured, you can switch at any time from 
one computing resource to another using the top left combo box.

Once connected to a computing resource, you can select a workflow in the list
or submit one. General information about the current workflow will be displayed 
in the bottom left window.


Workflow loading, submission and control
========================================

In the menu, select "File/Open" to load a workflow saved into a file. 
Then press the "submit" button to submit the workflow.

If a workflow is submitted outside of the GUI (using the python API for 
example) use the "refresh" button to load it into the GUI.

The expiration date of the current workflow is displayed below the workflow list 
and can be modified using the "change date" button.

Use the "delete" button to delete the current workflow. If the workflow is 
running, it will kill all the jobs running on the computing resource.

When a workflow ended with errors, you can use the "restart" button to submit 
again the jobs which failed.



Workflow representation in a tree view
======================================

The current workflow is displayed as a tree in the central window. The icons 
show the state of the workflow elements (see :ref:`status_list`). Gray 
icons mean that the workflow was not submitted yet.

The groups can be extended to be explored. Their icons are little disks.

* A blue disk: at least on job in running inside the group
* A red disk: at least on job failed inside the group
* A green disk: all the jobs finished with success inside the group.

The window below the tree view displays information about the item selected in the 
tree. If the selected item is a job you can display the content of its standard 
output and error clicking on the "standard output" and "standard error" tabs.
