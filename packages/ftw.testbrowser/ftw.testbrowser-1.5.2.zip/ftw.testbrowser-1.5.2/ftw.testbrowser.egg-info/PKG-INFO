        `ftw.testbrowser` is a browser library for testing `Plone`_ web sites and
        applications.
        It integrations directly into `Plone` / `Zope` and uses `lxml`_ for parsing
        and querying pages. It supports all the basic features such as filling forms.

        Changelog

        ------------------

        ------------------
        
        - Deprecate `normalized_text` method, replace it with `text` property.
          The `text` property is more intuitive and easier to remember.
          The `text` property has almost the same result as `normalized_text`,
          but it represents `<br/>` and `<p>` with single and double newlines respectively.
          `text` is to be the lxml `text` property, which contained the raw, non-recursive
          text of the current node and is now available as `raw_text` property.
