        Features:
        ---------
            * Manage Big project
            * Define various Phases of Project
            * Compute Phase Scheduling: Compute start date and end date of the phases
              which are in draft, open and pending state of the project given. If no
              project given then all the draft, open and pending state phases will be taken.
            * Compute Task Scheduling: This works same as the scheduler button on
              project.phase. It takes the project as argument and computes all the open,
              draft and pending tasks.
            * Schedule Tasks: All the tasks which are in draft, pending and open state
              are scheduled with taking the phase's start date.
