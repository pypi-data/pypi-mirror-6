        What is this?
        ============
        
        **psiTurk** is an open platform for conducting custom behavioral experiments on
        Amazon's Mechanical Turk. 
        
        It is intended to provide most of the backend machinery necessary to run your
        experiment. It uses AMT's _External Question_ HIT type, meaning that you can
        collect data using any website. As long as you can turn your experiment into a
        website, you can run it with **psiTurk**!
        
        Install
        =======
        
        The easiest way to install **psiTurk** is via `pip`.
        Simply type into a terminal:
        
            pip install psiturk 
        
        If this doesn't work, you might try `sudo pip install psiturk`.  Directions
        on how to install `pip` if you don't have it on your system are available in 
        our [documentation](https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/wiki/Getting-psiTurk-installed-on-your-computer#installation-steps).
        
        Mac users will need to install a C compiler via XCode first (available from the Mac App Store).
        Once it is installed, the command line compiler tools are made available from the preferences 
        menu as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9353468/62179).  On OS X Mavericks the
        command line tools are installed in a [new way](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18216865/how-to-install-command-line-tools-on-osx-mavericks).
        
        
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        Explore **psiTurk** with eight easy steps:
        
          1. Sign up for an AWS account, available [here](http://aws.amazon.com/).
          2. Sign up for a Mechanical Turk requester account, available [here](https://requester.mturk.com/).
          3. In a terminal, install **psiTurk** by typing `sudo pip install psiturk` (see [installation instructions](https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/wiki/Getting-psiTurk-installed-on-your-computer) for details).
          4. To use our demo, create a directory, open it e.g., `mkdir psiTurkDemo; cd psiTurkDemo`, and then issue the command `psiturk-setup-example`.
          5. Start the dashboard by typing `psiturk` on the commandline. The **psiTurk** dashboard will pop up in a new browser window. 
          6. Provide the dashboard with your AWS credentials. Skip this step if you just want to test an experiment locally by pressing "proceed without login". 
          7. To launch the experiment server, click the "turn on?" button in the upper right-hand corner. Once the experiment server is running, a green light will appear. 
          8. Click the "test" button to launch the **psiTurk** demo experiment in a new browser window.

        Experiment design
        =================
        
        We have provided an example stroop experiment that could form the basis of your
        own experiment. The task logic is programmed in Javascript, which will run in
        your participant's browser. Most of the code can be found in
        `static/js/task.js`.  It works by dynamically changing the html document served
        to participants in `templates/exp.html` and communicating with the server code
        which can be found in `psiturk/psiturk.py`. **psiTurk** assigns a condition and
        counterbalance to each participant. PsiTurk actively manages the condition and
        counterbalance subjects are assigned to, helping you fill them in evenly. These
        are fed into Javascript via code in `static/js/psiturk.js`. You can tell
        **psiTurk** how many conditions and counterbalance identities there are in the
        dashboard's "Expt Info" tab.
        
        Deployment
        ==========
        
        Configuration
        ------------
        To make your experiment available on the internet, make the following changes:
        
         - Under the `Server` tab change `Host` to `0.0.0.0`. 
         - Under the `HIT Config` tab change `Ad URL` to
           `http://yoururl:yourport/mturk`, replacing `yoururl` with the url to your
           server, and `yourport` with the port you have configured in `config.txt` (by
           default, 22362).
        
        Database
        --------
        
        We recommend using a deployment-robust database solution such as
        [MySQL](http://www.mysql.org) or [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org).
        SQLite does not allow concurrent access to the database, so if the locks work
        properly, simultaneous access (say, from multiple users submitting their data
        at the same time) could destabilize your database. In the worst (unlikely)
        scenario, the database could become corrupted, resulting in data loss.
        
        Instructions for setting up a MySQL server on a Mac can be found 
        [in the wiki](https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/wiki/Macintosh-Configuration).

        [mysql.org](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en//installing.html).
        
        FAQ
        ---
        
         * **I can't seem to get pip working**.  If you are having trouble setting up
           Python, we suggest installing the [Enthought Python
           Distribution](https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/), which is licensed
           for free to academics [at this
           link](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/academic/). It provides a
           kitchen-sink-included version of Python which includes `pip`.
