Description: dynamodb_utils
        ==============
        
        A toolchain for Amazon's `DynamoDB <http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/>`_ to make
        common operations easier. Currently contains:
        
        * ``dynamodb_dumper`` - backup tables out of DynamoDB with ease.
        * ``dynamodb_loader`` - restore tables dumped by ``dynamodb_dumper`` with ease.
        
        All tools are built to work with both the main DynamoDB service and DynamoDB
        Local so you can test them out, and also move data easily between production
        and your test environment.
        
        Install with:
        
            $ pip install dynamodb_utils
