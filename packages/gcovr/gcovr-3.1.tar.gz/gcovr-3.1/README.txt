Overview
--------

Gcovr provides a utility for managing the use of the GNU gcov utility
and generating summarized code coverage results. This command is
inspired by the Python coverage.py package, which provides a similar
utility in Python. The gcovr command produces either compact
human-readable summary reports, machine readable XML reports (in
Cobertura format) or simple HTML reports. Thus, gcovr can be viewed
as a command-line alternative to the lcov utility, which runs gcov
and generates an HTML-formatted report.

Gcovr is available under the BSD License.

A user guide can be downloaded from http://gcovr.com.

Gcovr development moved to this repository in September, 2013 from
Sandia National Laboratories.
