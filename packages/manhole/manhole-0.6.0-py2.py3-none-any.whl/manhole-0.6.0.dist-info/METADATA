Manhole is in-process service that will accept unix domain socket connections and present the
stacktraces for all threads and an interactive prompt. It can either work as a python daemon
thread waiting for connections at all times *or* a signal handler (stopping your application and
waiting for a connection).

Access to the socket is restricted to the application's effective user id or root.

This is just like Twisted's `manhole <http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.manhole.html>`__.
It's simpler (no dependencies), it only runs on Unix domain sockets (in contrast to Twisted's manhole which
can run on telnet or ssh) and it integrates well with various types of applications.

Usage
=====

Install it::

    pip install manhole

You can put this in your django settings, wsgi app file, some module that's always imported early etc::

    import manhole
    manhole.install() # this will start the daemon thread

    # and now you start your app, eg: server.serve_forever()

Now in a shell you can do either of these::

    netcat -U /tmp/manhole-1234
    socat - unix-connect:/tmp/manhole-1234
    socat readline unix-connect:/tmp/manhole-1234

Socat with readline is best (history, editing etc).

Sample output::

    $ nc -U /tmp/manhole-1234

Features
========

* Uses unix domain sockets, only root or same effective user can connect.
* Can run the connection in a thread or in a signal handler (see ``oneshot_on`` option).
* Can start the thread listening for connections from a singla handler (see ``activate_on`` option)
* Compatible with apps that fork, reinstalls the Manhole thread after fork - had to monkeypatch os.fork/os.forkpty for
  this.
* Compatible with gevent and eventlet with some limitations - you need to either:

  * Use ``oneshot_on``, *or*
  * Disable thread monkeypatching (eg: ``gevent.monkey.patch_all(thread=False)``, ``eventlet.monkey_patch(thread=False)``

* The thread is compatible with apps that use signalfd (will mask all signals for the Manhole threads).

Options
-------

``manhole.install(verbose=True, patch_fork=True, activate_on=None, sigmask=manhole.ALL_SIGNALS, oneshot_on=None)``

* ``verbose`` - set it to ``False`` to squelch the stderr ouput
* ``patch_fork`` - set it to ``False`` if you don't want your ``os.fork`` and ``os.forkpy`` monkeypatched
* ``activate_on`` - set to ``"USR1"``, ``"USR2"`` or some other signal name, or a number if you want the Manhole thread
  to start when this signal is sent. This is desireable in case you don't want the thread active all the time.
* ``oneshot_on`` - set to ``"USR1"``, ``"USR2"`` or some other signal name, or a number if you want the Manhole to
  listen for connection in the signal handler. This is desireable in case you don't want threads at all.
* ``sigmask`` - will set the signal mask to the given list (using ``signalfd.sigprocmask``). No action is done if
  ``signalfd`` is not importable. **NOTE**: This is done so that the Manhole thread doesn't *steal* any signals;
  Normally that is fine cause Python will force all the signal handling to be run in the main thread but signalfd
  doesn't.

What happens when you actually connect to the socket
----------------------------------------------------

1. Credentials are checked (if it's same user or root)
2. sys.__std\*__/sys.std\* are be redirected to the UDS
3. Stacktraces for each thread are written to the UDS
4. REPL is started so you can fiddle with the process


Whishlist
---------

* More configurable (chose what sys.__std\*__/sys.std\* to patch on connect time)
* Support windows ?!

Requirements
============

Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and PyPy are supported.

Similar projects
================

* Twisted's `old manhole <http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.manhole.html>`__ and the `newer
  implementation <http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.conch.manhole.html>`__ (colors, serverside
  history).
* `wsgi-shell <https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wsgi-shell>`_ - spawns a thread.
* `pyrasite <https://github.com/lmacken/pyrasite>`_ - uses gdb to inject code.
* `pydbattach <https://github.com/albertz/pydbattach>`_ - uses gdb to inject code.
