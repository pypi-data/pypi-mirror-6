        Introduction
        ============
        
        A doormat is a couple of links which are presented in a structured
        way. One example is the current plone.org_, where the div#sitemap at the bottom
        consists of some ordered bundles of internal and external links, with sections
        called "Downloads", "Documentation", "Developers", "Plone foundation" and
        "Support". See more examples_ of doormats.
        
        This product adds a couple of content types (Archetypes), which are used to
        create a structure which is used for generating a doormat. A viewlet on this
        doormat is placed in the Plone footer. The links in the Doormat are managed as
        content, making the Doormat more flexible than a sitemap.  It's also possible
        to add external links. It's also possible to add bits of text, with markup.

        collective.doormat
        ------------------
        
        collective.doormat_ also lets you creates a doormat in your site, but takes a different approach: Instead of creating a structure of content objects, it offers a configuration panel where you can create the doormat in a single rich text field.
        
        This approach is a lot easier for maintaining the doormat.
        
        It doesn't take permissions into account, so links might point to internal content to which the visitor viewing the page has no access. There is also no way to add content from collections.
        
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        After installing the product in your site, you should have a "Doormat" item in
        your Plone site, which should show up in the folder contents of the site.
        Inside it, you can create a hierarchical structure of Columns,
        Sections, links (both internal and external), Documents (Plone's Page type),
        and Links to a Collection (DoormatCollection).
        There should be one Column, one Section and one Document already there.
        
        The Doormat may look like this, schematically::

            +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        
        In fact, you can add more than one section, they will be displayed below each
        other. In each section, you can mix internal links, external links and
        Documents.
        
        And in real life:
        
        .. image:: http://plone.org/products/doormat/screenshot
        
        Note that the product adds an extra hierarchical layer compared to the
        plone.org_ doormat: it adds a Column, which can contain more than one Section.
        An example using this structure is the Oosterpoort_, which actually is the
        product's predecessor.
        
        
        Adding a Document
        =================
        
        Adding and editing a Document to the Doormat is just as simple as adding it in
        any other place. However, keep this in mind that only the "Body text" field
        will be displayed in the Doormat. Other fields, most notably the title and
        description will be omitted.
        
        Links in a Document
        -------------------
        
        By default, relative links will be created from the place where the Document
        lives. This link is then displayed in the Doormat on all pages, so it is very
        likely to be broken.
        
        The solution is to make your editor insert links by uid. With TinyMCE on Plone
        4, you can enable "link by uid" by going to the "Resource types" tab on TinyMCE
        Settings (via the "Site setup"), and checking the box called "Link using UIDs".
        
        This will apply to the whole site. You may want to revert to the default
        setting after you've added the link, as relative links are more desirable in
        general.
        
        Adding an Image
        ---------------
        
        To add an image to the Doormat, add a Document and include an image there. It's
        not possible to upload an Image to a DoormatSection, so you need to upload the
        image to another place in your site first.
        
        Make sure you enable "Link using UIDs" (see above) first, because defining the
        image's location in a relative way will break in the same way as a relative
        link will break.
        
        Links to Collections
        ====================
        
        It's also possible to add a "Link to Collection" item (DoormatCollection). This
        allows yout to point to a Plone Collection object, and take the items from
        that.
        
        
        Simple configuration
        ====================
        
        By default, the Doormat is excluded from navigation.
        
        There's a field `showTitle` on the folderish types (Doormat, Column and
        Section) which allows content managers to decide if the item's title should be
        displayed in the doormat.
        
        
        More advanced configuration and styling
        =======================================
        
        This section is intended for integrators and/or developers who would like to
        customize the way the doormat is rendered in more detail.
        
        Moving the doormat
        ------------------
        
        By default, the default doormat viewlet (`doormat.footer`) is placed in the
        `plone.portalfooter` viewlet manager. It's easy to modify this in an add-on
        product, so the doormat will display below the global navigation (portal tabs),
        or anywhere else in the site.
        
        
        Displaying the doormat without the extra div elements
        -----------------------------------------------------
        
        The default viewlet renders the doormat inside Plone's default footer elements,
        so it blends in with Plone 4's default Sunburst Theme::
        
          <div class="row">
            <div class="cell width-full position-0" >
              <div id="doormat-container" />
            </div>
          </div>
        
        Using the `doormat.footer.bare` viewlet will omit the two outermost <div>'s.
        This may be handy when using the doormat in a different theme, or in a
        customized layout. You can hide the default viewlet and enable the bare version
        through `@@manage-viewlets`, or by adding a customized `viewlets.xml` to the
        product you're developing.
        
        
        Caveats
        =======
        
        More than one Doormat
        ---------------------
        
        The viewlet does a catalog lookup for the `Doormat` portal type. If you have
        more than one object of this type (nothing stops you), it will use the oldest
        one.
        
        Uninstalling removes content
        ----------------------------
        
        If you run the uninstall profile, like when you uninstall the product, **all
        content will be deleted**. This ensures the product uninstalls cleanly, for
        the convenience of migrations and of those just wanting to try it out.
        
        If you have a Doormat in your site and you are happy with it, don't click
        uninstall.

        0.8 (2013-08-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Use archetypes.referencebrowserwidget in the DoormatReference if
          available.  Note: archetypes.referencebrowserwidget 2.4.15 and
          2.4.16 broke non-multi reference selection, so if your Plone version
          uses one of those versions, you should edit your buildout to use a
          newer version.

        ----------------
        
        Initial release
        
        For developers
        ==============
        
        UML deprecation notice
        ----------------------
        
        This product's content types were created with ArchGenXML (AGX), a tool to
        generate code from a UML model. AGX is no longer widely used, since Dexterity
        content types have replaced Archetypes as the default content type story.
        
        Since version 0.9, this package has tests, for which plone.app.testing is
        used. Making AGX work with this doesn't seem to be worth the trouble.
        Therefore the UML model and everything that's related to it was removed.
        
        You'll still find the UML and its documentation in a pre-0.9 version of the
        code.
        
        To do
        =====
        
        * Add some sort of caching for getDoormatData and getDoormatTitle methods, or
          for the entire viewlet. Or at least get an idea of how expensive they are.
          Currently the viewlet computes the whole doormat each time it is rendered.
