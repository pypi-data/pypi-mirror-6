Description: ==========
        GrapheekDB
        ==========
        
        GrapheekDB is a fast and lightweight Graph Database with various KVS (Key/Value Store) backends :
        
        - Local memory (default backend)
        - Kyoto Cabinet : http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/
        - Symas LMDB : http://symas.com/mdb/
        
        Implementing a new backend for other KVS is quite easy : Local Memory backend is implemented in less that 50 lines of code.
        
        Features :
        ----------
        
        - nodes (aka vertices) and edges creation and deletion
        - nodes and edge lookup (using a django-like syntax)
        - path traversal (using a gremlin-like syntax)
        - basic nodes & edges indexing feature (works with one or many field)
        - aggregation
        - speed : path traversal often occurs at 1 million entities/second - thanks to the backends :)
        - concurrency : with 1000 concurrent users and simple node creation/deletion, the server can handle 7000 requests/second - thanks to 0mq and gevent
        
        - code base test coverage is currently : 100 %
        
        
        Installation :
