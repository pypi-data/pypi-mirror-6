.. topic:: Application: retrieving information about a compound

    This section uses BioServices to demonstrate the interest of combining
    several services together within a single framework using the Python language as
    a glue language


Retrieve a compound identifier from KEGG, ChEBI and ChEMBL
--------------------------------------------------------------

Let us look at a compound called **Geldanamycin** that inhibits Hsp90. 
Let us search for information about that compound in several databases 
and manipulate the different identifiers. 

First, let us retrieve information on KEGG database::

    >>> from bioservices import *
    >>> k = Kegg(verbose=False)

KEGG compounds have links to other databases. It is not systematic but the ChEBI
database is often referenced. So we will want to convert the KEGG identifer to a
ChEBI identifier. Later, we can convert a ChEBI to a ChEMBL identifier using
another Web Service such as UniChem. 

We can get a mapping dictionary from the KEGG compound to ChEBI as follows:

.. doctest:: compound

    >>> map_kegg_chebi = k.conv("chebi", "compound")
    >>> len(map_kegg_chebi) # doctest: +SKIP
    6896

    >>> print(k.find("compound", "geldanamycin"))
    cpd:C11222  Geldanamycin
    cpd:C15823  Progeldanamycin
    <BLANKLINE>

Let us look at the first one (Kegg id cpd:C11222). We can get lots
of information from KEGG already by using:

.. doctest::
    :options: +SKIP

    >>> print(k.get("C11222"))

Form which, there is a link to other databases in particular ChEBI
(ChEBI:5292). We could use the mapping dictionary created above:

.. doctest:: compound

    >>> map_kegg_chebi['cpd:C11222']
    'chebi:5292'

Unfortunately, there is no mapping function from KEGG to ChEMBL in KEGG Web Service.

However, BioServices provides access to the :mod:`bioservices.unichem` service.
This service provides a useful mapping function from kegg to chembl::

    >>> uni = UniChem()
    >>> mapping = uni.get_mapping("kegg_ligand", "chembl")
    >>> mapping['C11222']
    'CHEMBL278315'

For sanity check, let us see that the ChEBI is indeed 5292 as given within the
KEGG database::

    >>> uni = UniChem()
    >>> mapping = uni.get_mapping("kegg_ligand", "chebi")
    >>> mapping['C11222']
    '5292'


(2) In order to convert KEGG gene names into uniprot gene name, we can also use
the UniProt web service from BioServices as follows::

   >>> from bioservices import *
   >>> u = UniProt()
   >>> u.mapping(fr='ID', to='KEGG_ID', format='tab', query="ZAP70_HUMAN")
   {'ZAP70_HUMAN':  'hsa:7535'}

You can get accession number or protein name identifier from the KEGG identifier
as follows::

   >>> u.mapping(fr='KEGG_ID', to='ID', format='tab', query='hsa:7535')
   {'hsa7535': 'ZAP70_HUMAN'}
   >>> u.mapping(fr='KEGG_ID', to='ACC', format='tab', query='hsa:7535')
   {'hsa7535': 'P43403'}
