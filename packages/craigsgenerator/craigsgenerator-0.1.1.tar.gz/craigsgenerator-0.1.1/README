Craig's Generator
=================
Read listings Pythonically.

Examples
---------
Generate listings.

.. code-block:: python

    from craigsgenerator import craigsgenerator
    for listing in craigsgenerator(sites = ['austin.craigslist.org'],sections=['sub']):
        print(listing)

Downloaded files are cached by default and refreshed
if they're older than a day. Change the directory by
specifying the :code:`cachedir`.

.. code-block:: python

    from craigsgenerator import Section
    for listing in Section('austin','sub', cachedir = 'downloads'):
        print(listing)
