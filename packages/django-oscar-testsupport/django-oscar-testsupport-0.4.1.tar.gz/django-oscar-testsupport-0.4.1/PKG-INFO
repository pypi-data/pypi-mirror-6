        Testing utilities for Oscar

        Warning
        -------
        
        As of Oscar 0.6, this package has been merged back into Oscar, within the
        ``oscar/test`` package.  There will be no 0.5 release of this package.
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        A simple package to allow the test utils from Oscar to be used by other
        packages.
        
        Contents:
        
        * A ``@dataProvider`` decorator for feeding test methods with different
          datasets.  This is a port of a useful PHPUnit feature.
        
        * A ``ClientTestCase`` which provides useful boilerplate functionality for when
          working with Django's test client.  It can set-up users as part of the
          ``setUp`` method.
        
        * A ``WebTestCase``, similar to the ``ClientTestCase`` but for working with
          WebTest.
        
        * Various factory methods for creating orders, products, offers and vouchers.
