        =============
        
        A logging handler for Splunk. Lets you send information to Splunk directly from your Python code.

        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            import logging
            from splunk_logger import SplunkLogger
            
            ACCESS_TOKEN = '...'
            PROJECT_ID = '...'
            
            splunk_logger = SplunkLogger(access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN, project_id=PROJECT_ID)
            logging.getLogger('').addHandler(splunk_logger)
            
            logging.error('This is sent to splunk')
            
        After a couple of seconds of waiting for Splunk to process the new information,
        you should be able to see something like this in the web interface:
        
        ::
        
            {
                data : "This is sent to splunk",
                level : "ERROR",
                line : 1,
                module : "<stdin>"
            }
        
        When using the code in a real Python program, and not from the python console,
        the real line number and module name are used.
        
        Configuration file
        ==================
        
        It is always a good idea to avoid hardcoded credentials in your source code.
        The module can fetch the credentials from a YAML file in the current directory
        or the user's home. The filename is named ``.splunk_logger`` and has the following
        format:
        
        ::
        
            credentials:
                project_id: ...
                access_token: ...
        
        Once the file is in place, you can use the module as follows:
        
        ::
        
            import logging
            from splunk_logger import SplunkLogger
            
            splunk_logger = SplunkLogger()
            logging.getLogger('').addHandler(splunk_logger)
            
            logging.error('This is sent to splunk')
        
        
        Configuration through environment variables
        ===========================================
        
        Another project ID and access token source which this module accepts are the ``SPLUNK_PROJECT_ID``
        and ``SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN``. Once again, you can use them to avoid hard-coding
        credentials in the source code.
        
        Enhancements
        ============
        
        There are a couple of things which could be improved in this module
        
        * The logger could be refactored to send the messages in an async manner,
          this will make ``logging.foo()`` calls return immediately instead of waiting
          for the log message to be sent.  
        * Send messages in batches
         
        Pull requests are more than welcome!
