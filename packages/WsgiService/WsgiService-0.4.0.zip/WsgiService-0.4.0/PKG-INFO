Description: WsgiService is a lean Python WSGI framework for very easy creation of REST
        services.
        
        A REST service in this context is a HTTP service to be used by machines. So a
        service should output something like XML, JSON or any other machine-readable
        format.

        GOALS
        =====
        
        The primary guiding principle is that the actual service should be as easy and
        small to write as possible. And here's what the WsgiService framework will do
        for the developer:
        
        * Abstract away error and status code handling
        * Make it easy to create machine readable output
        * Easily validate input
        * Easy deployment using good configuration file handling
        * Make testing easy
        * Create usable REST API documentation from source
        * Content negotiation to automatically use the correct output format
        
        Just as important as what WsgiService tries to accomplish is what it will
        never be:
        
        * WsgiService is not planning to be a full-featured frontend framework. Use
          your existing framework of choice for that, e.g. Pylons.
