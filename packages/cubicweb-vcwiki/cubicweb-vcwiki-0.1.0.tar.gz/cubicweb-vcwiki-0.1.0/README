Currently, to use, you need the following steps:

1. The administrator must create a `Repository` entity and set its `path`
   attribute to a valid path to a Mercurial repository (which must be created
   beforehand).

2. The administrator must add write permissions for the `Repository`, via
   the `localperms` cube (action available at the left of the screen).

3. The administrator must perform a "Refresh repository" action, also available
   at the left of the screen.

4. Create a `VcWiki` entity and set `rst` as default extension.

5. You should be able to create your wiki homepage through the `wiki homepage`
   action on the left.

note: The Wiki pages are available at an address which has the following 
format: http://<cubicweb_instance:port>/wiki/<wiki_name>/<page_name>.
