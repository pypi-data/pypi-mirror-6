This is the nori library for wrapping scripts.  It provides tools
such as powerful lockfile checking, logging, command-line
processing, and config setting validation, and is particularly
helpful for scripts that need to be run from cron with minimal
intervention and maximal stability (although it can also be helpful
in other cases.)
