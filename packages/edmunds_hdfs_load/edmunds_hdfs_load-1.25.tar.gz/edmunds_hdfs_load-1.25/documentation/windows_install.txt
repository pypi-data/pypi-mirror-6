How to setup Python with PIP on Windows:

1. Install python 2.7

https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6

2. Set up Python environment variable
System Properties-->Advanced Tab-->Environment Variables.(right click "My Computer " select "properties", "Advanced Tab" "Environment Variables" Button).

Add a new system wide variable named PYTHON_HOME which is equal to C:\python27 (or where ever python was installed)

Open up the environment variable PATH and add to the end:
:%PYTHON_HOME%

3. Open up MS DOS Prompt and type in python. If all goes well it should take you to the python interpreter (you can exit out of this by typing ctl-d)

4. Install Pip

http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html

2. Run "python get-pip.py" (in the directory where get-pip.py is located)
