lib2d is a 2D drawing and animation library for games. Both the C and Python
API are given equal love and is suitable for games made with either language.

lib2d is not a standalone game engine. An OpenGL context will need to be
created before instantiating a lib2d scene. SDL2 is used by the example
programs, but lib2d's only dependency is OpenGL.


Rabbyt's spiritual successor
----------------------------

lib2d doesn't attempt to mimic Rabbyt's API or feature set. Instead, lib2d
tries to learn from Rabbyt's mistakes while retaining the same goals and ideas.
lib2d is as close to a Rabbyt 2.0 as you'll get.

Some things lib2d does different from Rabbyt:

* Python 3 support.
* Better performance.
* OpenGL ES 2.0
* Simplified API.
* C implementation and API, using ctypes to create a pythonic API.
