PyHCUP is a Python library for parsing and importing data obtained from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Program (http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov).

In particular, most of the data provided by HCUP is in fixed-width text (ASCII or \*.asc) files, with meta data available in separate load files. This library is built to use the SAS format load files (\*.sas).
