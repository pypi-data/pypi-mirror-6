Description: General Information
        ===================
        
        This program is a tool to translate and create automatically an srt file to be used as a subtitle
        for your video, to be auto reproduce in your language.
        
        Supported on the google api for google-translate and based on the parser library pysrt with this
        program you will be able to translate in a matter of seconds your subtitles from the origin
        language for your videos.
        
        The flow of work is something like this:
        
        1. Download or create your subtitle for your videos in `srt format`_ in your language.
        2. Run this script telling the origin and destiny.
        3. Gualá your subtitle is in other language.
        
        .. note::
            
            This translations are not perfect due to the normal leak of quality of google translate,
            remember install a `program`_ to post-edit your subtitles easily. and this is a list of `players`_
            which support natively this subs.

        quickly with pip.::

        and local variables in this case the file will be read from the location where you are.

            [__main__]
            input_lang = en #origin lang of your subtitle
            output_lang = es #destiny lang of your subtitles

            google_api_key = INSERTHEREYOURKEY #your api key generated in google develper console
        
        Usage.
        ------
        
        Some examples about how to use it.
        
        1.- Translating a file and saving it in the same folder from english to spanish.::
        
            $pysrttranslator file.srt -i en -o es
        
        With this command you will obtain a file called `file.es.srt` just beside the file.srt file.
        
        2.- Translating a file and saving the result in other folder from english to spanish.::
        
            $pysrttranslator file.srt /path/destiny/fileoutput.srt -i en -o es
        
        3.- Run this command to get all options.::
        
            $pysrttranslator --help
        
        Options availables.
