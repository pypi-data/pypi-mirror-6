Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package contains a set of tools to help manage translations
        in Python software. 
        
        
        Babel extraction plugins
        ========================
        
        lingua contains two extraction plugins for `Babel
        <http://babel.edgewall.org/>`_:
        
        * ``lingua_python``, which supports translation strings as used in `Pyramid
          <http://pylonsproject.org>`_ (via `translationstring
          <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/translationstring>`_) and Zope2/ZTK (via
          `zope.i18nmessageid <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.i18nmessageid>`_).
        * ``lingua_xml``, which supports the i18n syntax as used by `Chameleon
          <http://pagetemplates.org/>`_ and Zope PageTempaltes,
        
        Detailed information on using Babel extraction plugins can be found in the
        `Babel documentation
        <http://babel.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/setup.html#method-mapping>`_.
        
        
        Translating via spreadsheets
        ============================
        
        Not all translators are comfortable with using PO-editors such as `Poedit
        <http://www.poedit.net/>`_ or translation tools like `Transifex
        <http://trac.transifex.org/>`_. For them lingua has simple tools to convert
        PO-files to `xls`-files and back again. This also has another benefit: it is
        possible to include multiple languages in a single spreadsheet, which is
        helpful when translating to multiple similar languages at the same time (for
        example simplified and traditional chinese).
        
        The format for spreadsheets is simple: the first column lists the canonical
        text, and all further columns contain a translation for the text, with the
        language code on the first row. Fuzzy translations are marked in italic.
        
        Converting one or more PO-files to an xls file is done with the `po-to-xls`
        command::
        
            po-to-xls -p nl nl.po texts.xls
        
        This will create a new file `texts.xls` with the Dutch translations. The `-p`
        parameter can be given multiple times to include more languages::
        
            po-to-xls -p zh_CN zh_CN.po -p zh_TW zh_TW.po -p nl nl.po texts.xls
        
        This will generate a file with all simplified chinese, traditional chinese and
        Dutch translations.
        
        
        Translations can be merged back from a spreadsheet into a PO-file using the
        `xls-to-po` command::
        
            xls-to-po nl texts.xls nl.po
        
        This will take the Dutch (`nl`) translations from `texts.xls` and use those to
        upgrade the `nl.po` file.
        
        
        Sanity checking
        ===============
        
        Lingua includes a simple `polint` tool which performs a few basic checks on PO
        files. Currently implemented tests are:
        
        * duplicated message ids (can also be checked with `msgfmt`). These should
          never happen and are usually a result of a bug in the message extraction
          logic.
        
        * identical translations used for multiple canonical texts. This can happen
          for valid reasons, for example when the original text is not spelled
          consistently.
        
        To check a po file simply run `polint` with the po file as argument::
        
            polint nl.po
        
            Translation:
                ${val} ist keine Zeichenkette
            Used for 2 canonical texts:
            1       ${val} is not a string
            2       "${val}" is not a string
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.6 - December 9, 2013
        ----------------------
        
        - Add support for ngettext and pluralize() for correctly generating plurals in
          pot files.
        
        
        1.5 - April 1, 2013
        -------------------
        
        - Do not silently ignore XML parsing errors. Instead print an error message
          and abort.
        
        
        1.4 - February 11, 2013
        -----------------------
        
        - Po->XLS convertor accidentily included obsolete messages.
        
        
        1.3 - January 28, 2012
        ----------------------
        
        - XLS->Po conversion failed for the first language if no comment or
          reference columns were generated. Reported by Rocky Feng.
        
        - Properly support Windows in the xls-po convertors: Windows does not
          support atomic file renames, so revert to shutils.rename on that
          platform. Reported by Rocky Feng.
        
        
        1.2 - January 13, 2012
        ----------------------
        
        - Extend XML extractor to check python expressions in templates. This
          fixes `issue 7 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/pull/7>`_. Thanks to
          Nuno Teixeira for the patch.
        
        
        1.1 - November 16, 2011
        -----------------------
        
        - Set 'i18n' attribute as default prefix where there was no prefix found.
          This fixes issues `5 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/5>`_ and
          `6 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/5>`_. Thanks to
          Mathieu Le Marec - Pasquet for the patch.
        
        
        1.0 - September 8, 2011
        -----------------------
        
        - Update XML extractor to ignore elements which only contain a Chameleon
          expression (``${....}``). These can happen to give the template engine
          a hint that it should try to translate the result of an expression. This
          fixes `issue 2 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/2>`_.
        
        * Update XML extractor to not abort when encountering undeclared
          namespaces. This fixes `issue 3
          <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/3>`_.
        
        * Fix Python extractor to handle strings split over multiple lines
          correctly.
        
        
        1.0b4 - July 20, 2011
        ---------------------
        
        * Fix po-to-xls when including multiple languages in a single xls file.
        
        
        1.0b3 - July 18, 2011
        ---------------------
        
        * Paper brown bag: remove debug leftover which broke po-to-xls.
        
        
        1.0b2 - July 18, 2011
        ---------------------
        
        * Update PO-XLS convertors to allow selection of comments to include in
          the xls files.
        
        * Correct XML extractor to strip leading and trailing white. This fixes
          `issue 1 <https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/1>`_.
        
        * Add a very minimal polint tool to perform sanity checks in PO files.
        
        * Update trove data: Python 2.4 is not supported due to lack of absolute
          import ability.
        
        
        1.0b1 - May 13, 2011
        --------------------
        
        * First release.
