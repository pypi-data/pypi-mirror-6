Annotation-based selection
==========================

Another common way of exploiting annotations consists in using them to select
the segments that will be in-/excluded by an instance of :ref:`Select` (see
:doc:`Partitioning segmentations <partitioning_segmentations>`) or
:ref:`Intersect` (see
:doc:`Using a segmentation to filter another <using_segmentation_filter_another>`).
Thus, in the case of the XML data example introduced
:doc:`here <converting_xml_markup_annotations>` (and further developed
:doc:`there <merging_units_annotations>`), we might insert an instance of
:ref:`Select` between those of :ref:`Select` and :ref:`Count` (see
:ref:`figure 1 <annotation_based_selection_fig1>` below) in order to include
only "content words".

In this simplified example, the :ref:`Intersect` instance could thus be
parametered as indicated on :ref:`figure 2 <annotation_based_selection_fig1>`
below), so as to exclude (**Mode: Exclude**) those segments whose annotation
value for key *type* (**Annotation key**: *type*) is *DET* or *PREP*
(**Regex:** ``^(DET|PREP)$``).
