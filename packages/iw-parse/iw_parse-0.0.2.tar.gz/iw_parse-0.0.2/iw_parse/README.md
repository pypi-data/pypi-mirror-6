iw_parse
========

Parse the output of iwlist scan to get the name, address, quality, channel, and encryption type of all networks broadcasting within your Wireless NIC's reach.

Usage
-----

```bash
iwlist <INTERFACE_NAME> scan | ./iw_parse
```

Replace `<INTERFACE_NAME>` with the system name for your wireless NIC. It is usually something like `wlan0`. The command `iwconfig` will list all of your network interfaces.

Example:

```bash
iwlist wlan0 scan | ./iw_parse
```
