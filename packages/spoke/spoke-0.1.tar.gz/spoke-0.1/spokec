"""spokec [flags] spoke [spoke [...]] [-spoke [-spoke]]
spokec [-h|--help] [-c config|--config=file] [-p path|--path=path]
       [-o output|--output=file] spoke [spoke [...]] [-spoke [...]]

Usage:

    Generates the specified spoke(s) to standard output (or to a file
    specified with the -o option). For example:

        spokec header footer profile > profile_page.js

    Would generate the spokes for 'header', 'footer' and 'profile'. Spokes
    that might be pulled in as dependencies may be excluded by passing the
    spoke name prefixed with a '-'. For example:

        spokec header footer profile -backbone -underscore

    Would generate the same spoke as above, less the backbone and underscore
    spokes.

Options:

    -h, --help
        Print a usage to stdout and exit.

    -c config, --config=file
        Path to config file. This argument will override the SPOKE_CONFIG
        environment variable.

        default: /etc/spoke.cfg

    -o output, --output=file
        Path to output file. If specified, spokec will generate a temporary
        file named <file>.tmp which it will write to, before atomically
        installing the spoke to <file> using the rename(2) system call.

    -p path, --path=path
        ':' delimited list of directories used to look up spokes. This
        argument will override the SPOKE_PATH environment variable.

        default: /var/spoke/

Environment:

    SPOKE_PATH
        Override the spoke path (same as -p path). If set, this environment
        variable will override `path` set in the SPOKE_CONFIG file.

    SPOKE_CONFIG
        Override the path to the spoke config (same as -c config)

Config:

    Spokes are defined by a configuration file (default: /etc/spoke.cfg)
    conforming to the following convention:

        # the spoke program config section
        [spoke]
        path    = '/var/spoke/'
        include = '/etc/spoke/*.cfg'

        # configuration for a specific spoke
        [a_spoke]
        js     = 'a_spoke.js'
        css    = ['main.css', 'grid.css']
        html   = ['a_spoke.html.tpl']
        spokes = 'backbone'

        [backbone]
        js     = 'backbone.js'

    The default configuration file can be overridden by using the -c option
