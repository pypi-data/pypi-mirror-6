mongodict - MongoDB-backed Python dict-like interface
=====================================================

So you are storing some key-values in a ``dict`` but your data became huge than
your memory or you want to persist it on the disk? Then `mongodict
<https://github.com/turicas/mongodict>`_ is for
you!

As it uses `MongoDB <http://mongodb.org/>`_ to store the data, you get all cool
`MongoDB <http://mongodb.org/>`_ things, like shardings and replicas. It uses
the `pickle` module available on Python standard library to
serialize/deserialize data and store everything as `bson.Binary` in MongoDB.
You can also provide another codec (serializer/deserializer).

`mongodict <https://github.com/turicas/mongodict>`_ is tested under
`Python 2.7.5 <http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/>`_ and
`Python 3.3.2 <http://www.python.org/getit/releases/3.2/>`_.


Installation
------------

As simple as::

    pip install mongodict


Usage
-----

As it uses
`collections.MutableMapping <http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#collections.MutableMapping>`_
as its base, you just need to change the line which creates your ``dict``.
For instace, just replace::

    >>> my_dict = {}

with::

    >>> from mongodict import MongoDict
    >>> my_dict = MongoDict(host='localhost', port=27017, database='my_dict',
                            collection='store')

and then use it like a normal ``dict``::

    >>> my_dict['python'] = 'rules'
    >>> print my_dict['python']
    rules
    >>> del my_dict['python']
    >>> print my_dict['python']
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File "mongodict.py", line 82, in __getitem__
        raise KeyError(key)
    KeyError: u'python'
    >>> my_dict['spam'] = 'eggs'
    >>> my_dict['ham'] = 'damn'
    >>> for key, value in my_dict.items():
    ...    print '{} = {}'.format(key, value)
    ...
    spam = eggs
    ham = damn

If you want to use another codec, you should pass serialize and deserialize
functions to the class during the initialization. For example, to use JSON::

    >>> import json
    >>> json_dict = MongoDict(host='localhost', port=27017,
                              database='json_dict', collection='store',
                              codec=(json.dumps, json.loads))
    >>> # use json_dict as usual

Enjoy! :-)

.. NOTE::
   There is no kind of in-memory cache, so all key lookups will be translated
   in a `MongoDB <http://mongodb.org/>`_ query but as
   `MongoDB <http://mongodb.org/>`_'s server put everything it can in memory,
   probably it'll not be a problem (if your working set is always entire in
   memory).


Authentication
--------------

If you want to use MongoDB's authentication to the database ``MongoDict`` is
connecting to, you just need to provide an ``auth`` parameter, as in this
example::


    from mongodict import MongoDict


    my_dict = MongoDict(host='localhost', port=27017, database='mydb',
                        collection='mongodict',
                        auth=('my username', 'my password'))



Why not Redis?
--------------

`Redis <http://redis.io/>`_ is "remote directory server" - it's a great piece
of software and can do the job if all your data fit on memory. By other side,
`MongoDB <http://mongodb.org/>`_ already have mature sharding and replica set
features. So, if you need to store lots of key-value pairs that don't fit on
memory, `mongodict <https://github.com/turicas/mongodict>`_ can solve your
problem.

.. NOTE::
   `mongodict <https://github.com/turicas/mongodict>`_ does not have the same
   API other key-value software have
   (like `memcached <http://memcached.org/>`_). Some features are missing to
   compete directly with these kind of software (by now we have only the
   ``dict``-like behaviour), but I have plans to add it soon.

  `Test-Driven Development <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>`_.

You can run the tests either with or without
`tox <http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.

Without tox
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the simplest approach: you'll test only for one Python version. To do
it, just execute::

    mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages mongodict-without-tox
    pip install -r requirements/develop.txt
    make test


With tox
~~~~~~~~

With `tox <http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ you can test for
more than one Python version (currently for 2.7 and 3.2). You just need to
create a virtualenv, install and run it::

    mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages tox-for-mongodict
    pip install tox
    tox

`tox <http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ will create one
virtualenv for each Python version, install requirements and then run the tests
for each of them. Note that you need the python binaries available in your
system (2.7 and 3.2) to run the tests.
