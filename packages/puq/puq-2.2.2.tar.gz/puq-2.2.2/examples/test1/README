test1.py creates two normally-distributed parameters and
uses them with a level-3 Smolyak method.

The test program, test1_prog.py simply returns
0.5*m*v**2

You run this by doing
>puq start test1

You can reuse the same response surface with adjusted PDFs by doing
> puq analyze --using new_pdfs.py
