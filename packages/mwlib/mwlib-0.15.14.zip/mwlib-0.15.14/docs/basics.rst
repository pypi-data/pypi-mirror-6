Getting started
=================

mwlib provides a library for parsing MediaWiki articles and
converting them to different output formats.

The collection extension is a MediaWiki extensions enabling users to
collect articles and generate PDF files from those.

Both components are used by wikipedia's 'Print/export' feature.

If you're running a low-traffic public mediawiki installation, you
only have to install the collection extension. You'll have to use the
public render server run by pediapress GmbH. Please read
:doc:`collection`.

If you need to run your own render server instance, you'll have to
install mwlib and mwlib.rl first. Please read :doc:`installation`.
