Description: Pint: a Python units library
        ============================
        
        Pint is Python module/package to define, operate and manipulate physical
        quantities: the product of a numerical value and a unit of measurement.
        It allows arithmetic operations between them and conversions from and
        to different units.
        
        It is distributed with a comprehensive list of physical units, prefixes
        and constants. Due to it's modular design, you to extend (or even rewrite!)
        the complete list without changing the source code.
        
        It has a complete test coverage. It runs in Python 2.7 and 3.X
        with no other dependency. It licensed under BSD.
        
        
        Design principles
        -----------------
        
        Although there are already a few very good Python packages to handle physical
        quantities, no one was really fitting my needs. Like most developers, I programed
        Pint to scratch my own itches.
        
        - Unit parsing: prefixed and pluralized forms of units are recognized without
          explicitly defining them. In other words: as the prefix *kilo* and the unit *meter*
          are defined, Pint understands *kilometers*. This results in a much shorter and
          maintainable unit definition list as compared to other packages.
        
        - Standalone unit definitions: units definitions are loaded from simple and
          easy to edit text file. Adding and changing units and their definitions does
          not involve changing the code.
        
        - Advanced string formatting: a quantity can be formatted into string using
          PEP 3101 syntax. Extended conversion flags are given to provide latex and pretty
          formatting.
        
        - Small codebase: small and easy to maintain with a flat hierarchy.
        
        - Dependency free: it depends only on Python and it's standard library.
        
        - Python 2 and 3: A single codebase that runs unchanged in Python 2.7+ and Python 3.0+.
        
        - Advanced NumPy support: While NumPy is not a requirement for Pint,
          when available ndarray methods and ufuncs can be used in Quantity objects.
