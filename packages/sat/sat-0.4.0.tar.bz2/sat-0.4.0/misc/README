This directory contains files related to SÃ T but not directly used by it.

* file _jp:
    This is the completion file for zsh. To use it, you need to have it in a path accessible in your fpath variable, and to have completion activated. This can be done by the following commands in your .zshrc:

### .zshrc completion ###
fpath=(/path/to/directory/with/_jp/ $fpath)
autoload -U compinit
compinit
### end of .zshrc completion ###

    Then, you should be able to complete a jp command line by pressing [TAB].
