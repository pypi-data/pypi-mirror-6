New features in releases prior to 2.6 are not listed in here.

SilvaNewsNetwork 2.6
====================

This release of SilvaNewsNetwork contains a number of new features,
bugfixes, and some major code refactoring.  Most of the changes in
2.6 will not be visible to the SNN user, however there are a few
significant ones that are:

News Category Filter Assets
---------------------------

As time goes on, large Silva installations will have a large number 
of subjects and target audiences, many of which are only relevant 
within a single publication or folder.  This large number of 
categories creates clutter when working with SilvaNews objects, 
making it difficult to see and select the categories for that
particular object.

Category Filters provide a means to manage the news categories that 
are available within a container in Silva.  They can be added to 
any container, and allow Silva users to filter the news categories 
that are available to News objects (News and Agenda Filters, 
Articles, Agenda Items, etc.) within that container and its 
sub-containers.

Improved Syndication Support
----------------------------

SilvaNewsNetwork syndication support has been rewritten to use the
new syndication functionality in Silva 2.0. Both rss and atom 
syndication formats are supported on News and Agenda Viewers and
RSSAggregators, by appending '/rss.xml' or '/atom.xml' to the 
public url of the viewer. 

InlineNewsViewer Improvements
-----------------------------

The default InlineNewsViewer (INV) formulator form and view templates
have new features including: containing div id and class, specifying 
article level, optional image thumbnail, where and whether to place 
links to articles, and possible a few others.  

If you're using the default INV, you should refresh the template by 
going to the each INV's url and adding '/refresh', e.g. 
http://server.com/silva/inv/refresh

NOTE: doing so will probably break any document that uses the INV, so
you'll want to revisit each to ensure they are still working and to
enable any new functionality.
