Welcome to PySmartDL's documentation!
=====================================

``pySmartDL`` strives to be a full-pleged smart download manager for Python.
Typical usage often looks like this::

	import os
	from pySmartDL import SmartDL

	url = "http://mirror.ufs.ac.za/7zip/9.20/7za920.zip"
	dest = "C:\\Downloads\\"

	obj = SmartDL(url, dest)
	obj.start()

	# [*] 0.23 / 0.37 MB @ 88.00KB/s [##########--------] [60%, 2s left]

	os.startfile(obj.get_dest()) # get_dest() returns the destination of the downloaded file.
