        Feedjack is a feed aggregator writen in Python using the Django web development
        framework.
        
        Like the Planet feed aggregator:
        
            * It downloads feeds and aggregate their contents in a single site
            * The new aggregated site has a feed of its own (atom and rss)
            * It uses Mark Pilgrim’s excelent FeedParser
            * The subscribers list can be exported as OPML and FOAF
        
        But FeedJack also has some advantages:
        
            * It handles historical data, you can read old posts
            * It parses a lot more info, including post categories
            * It generates pages with posts of a certain category
            * It generates pages with posts from a certain subscriber
            * It generates pages with posts of a certain category from a certain
               subcriber
            * A cloud tag/folksonomy (hype 2.0 compliant) for every page and every
              subscriber
            * It uses Django templates
            * The administration is done via web (using Django's kickass autogenerated
              and magical admin site), and can handle multiple planets
            * Extensive use of django’s internal cache engine. Most of the time you
              will have no database hits when serving pages.

        CHANGES:
        
        Feedjack 0.9.17
        * put in views.something instead of using the deprecated
          simple.redirect_to. I'm certain there is a better way but this seems
          to work
          [Mike Hostetler]
        
        * verify_exists was deprecated
          [Mike Hostetler]
        
        * use hashlib instead of md5
          [Mike Hostetler]
        
        Feedjack 0.9.16.1
        * Add product dependencies to setup.py
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        Feedjack 0.9.16
        * Added compatibility with Django 1.0 beta 1: newforms admin and pagination
        
        Feedjack 0.9.15
        * Fixing feedjack_update for posts without a modified date (yay rss 0.92!)
        
        Feedjack 0.9.15
        * Fixing feedjack_update for posts without a modified date (yay rss 0.92!)
        
        Feedjack 0.9.14
        * Lots of fixes/improvements in feedjack_update.py:
          - better unicode handling on logging, this will prevent feeds not updating
            when using the --verbose flag
          - Multithreaded feed fetching, needs the threadpool module, available in
            http://www.chrisarndt.de/projects/threadpool/
            By default 10 threads will be used, can be modified with the -w option
            If the threadpool module is not available, the old (SLOW) single
            threaded method will be used.
          - Improved logging. Since multiple feeds can be processed in parallel now,
            all log entries go in a single line, with the feed id as a prefix.
          - Stats in the logging, how many new posts, updated posts, unmodified posts
            and errors were found per feed and globally, and feed status (ok,
            unchanged, can't parse feed, http error, some exception)
          - Reporting slow feeds, if a feed takes longer than 10 seconds to process, it
            will appear in the logs with the tag "(SLOW FEED!)"
        
        Feedjack 0.9.12
        * Feedjack is now django-unicode compliant
        * Using max_length instead of maxlength in models.py to prevent warnings in
          syncdb
        * Patched fjlib to use the new django refactored database backends
        * Disabling autoscaping for post contents in the included templates
        * Handling of feedparser returning an empty etag
        * Fixing encoding related problems in tag urls
        * Non-integer page parameters should be handled correctly
        
        Feedjack 0.9.10
        * Fixing CSS tags for styles 4 and 5
        * feedjack_update now strip()s tags before storing them
        * feedjack_update shows the feed number being processed
        * We no longer cache the tags in feedjack_update, it had encoding problems and
          makes the script safe to run more than one instance at the same time
        
        Feedjack 0.9.9
        * Fixed i18n related bugs in the templates
        * Fixed a bug related to the --settings option in feedjack_update.py
        * The feeds per user, tag and user/tag are working again
        * You can choose between rss2 and atom in the feeds for user, tag and user/tag
        * The default /feed/ url now redirects to /feed/atom/ instead of /feed/rss/ 
        
        Feedjack 0.9.8
        * Internationalization (petar)
        * Fixed and infinite loop in feedjack_update.py (do'h!) (petar)
        * Added Serbian (Latin) translation (petar)
        * Updated the feedparser calls in feedjack_update.py (petar)
        * Added Spanish translation (predius)
        
        
        Feedjack 0.9.7
        * The request handler uses PATH_INFO when REQUEST_URI is not available (like
          in Django's development server)
        * Etags keep their quotation marks when stored.
        * The update_feeds.py got a lot of love:
          - Every option has a help string (try with --help)
          - A --verbose option. Default behavior is non-verbose and shows only the
            current feed being analyzed and errors.
          - A --timeout option to set the wait timeout in seconds when connecting to
            feeds.
        
        Feedjack 0.9.6
        * Fixed a bug in the feedjack_update.py script that wasn't handling the
          same blog with multiple feeds correctly.
        
        Feedjack 0.9.5
        * First public release
