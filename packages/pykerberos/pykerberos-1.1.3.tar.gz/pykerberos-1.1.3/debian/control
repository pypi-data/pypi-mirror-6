Description: Kerberos high-level interface
 .
 This Python package is a high-level wrapper for Kerberos (GSSAPI)
 operations.  The goal is to avoid having to build a module that wraps the
 entire Kerberos.framework, and instead offer a limited set of functions
 that do what is needed for client/server Kerberos authentication based
 on <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt>.
