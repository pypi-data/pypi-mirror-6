        Captcha Support for Silva
        -------------------------
        
        This is a captcha support for Silva. It works with the help of
        ``collective.captcha``, and ``plone.keyring``.
        
        After installing the extension, you can either use a formlib widget,
        or ask the captcha directly.
        
        You can get the captcha image in your template the following way::
        
           <tal:captcha tal:define="captcha nocall:here/@@captcha"
                        tal:content="structure captcha/image_tag">
           </tal:captcha>
        
        You can get the captcha as a sound file like this::
        
           <div class="captchaAudio"
                tal:define="captcha nocall:here/@@captcha">
              <a href="#" target="_blank"
                 tal:attributes="href captcha/audio_url">Audio version</a>
           </div>
        
        You can validate an captcha entry like this::
        
           from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
        
        
           captcha = getMultiAdapter((self.context, self.request), name='captcha')
           if not captcha.verify(input):
               # Bad value
           else:
               # Good value
        
        This extension require at least `Silva`_ 2.0.7 or higher. You can have
        more information about `collective.captcha`_.
        
        Use in Python Script
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In your Python Script/Code Sources, you can use for example::
        
          from silva.captcha import validate
        
          request = context.REQUEST
          input = request.form.get('captcha_field', None)
          if not validate(context, request, input):
              # Bad value
          else:
              # Good value
        
        
        This will validate (or not) the input of the captcha.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you installed Silva using buildout, by getting one from the `Infrae
        SVN`_ repository, or creating one using `Paster`_, you should edit your
        buildout configuration file ``buildout.cfg`` to add or edit the
        following section::
        
          [instance]
        
          eggs = ...
                silva.captcha
        
          zcml = ...
                silva.captcha
        
        If the section ``instance`` wasn't already in the configuration file,
        pay attention to re-copy values for ``eggs`` and ``zcml`` from the
        profile you use.
        
        After you can restart buildout::
        
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        
        If you don't use buildout, you can install this extension using
        ``easy_install``, and after create a file called
        ``silva.captcha-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  This file will
        responsible to load the extension and should only contain this::
        
          <include package="silva.captcha" />
