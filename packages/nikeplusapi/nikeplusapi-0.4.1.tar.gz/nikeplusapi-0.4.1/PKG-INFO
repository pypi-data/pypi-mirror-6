Description: # Nikeplus data export
        
        The purpose of this project is to export your
        [nike plus](http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/) data to CSV format.
        
        ## Install
        
        - Install package with the standard `pip` workflow:
            - `pip install nikeplusapi`
        
        - Install package for development:
            - git clone repositiory
            - cd into repository
            - `pip install .` OR `python setup.py develop` OR `python setup.py install`
        
        Now you should have a top-level script called `nikeplusapi`.
        Run `nikeplusapi -h` to verify install worked properly.
        
        ## Usage
        
        1. The only requirement for this script is the NikePlus API access token.  You
           can get your token by logging into the
           [Nike developer site](https://developer.nike.com/login/) with your Nike+
           account credentials.
        2. You can pass your token via the command-line `-t` option or store it in your
           home directory in a file called `.nikeplus_access_token` that will be read
           automatically when the script executes.
        3. This script will output the CSV data directly to `stdout` so you can easily
           re-direct this to a file with the following:
            `nikeplus > backup.csv`.
