Description: =============
        Gift Registry
        =============
        
        Gift Registry is a minimal wedding registry app. Guests can browse the list of
        gifts you've added, then reserve one by entering their email address. If it's a
        one-only type gift, the item is marked as chosen so you don't receive two. No
        payments are taken.
        
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add required INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
               INSTALLED_APPS = (
                   ...
        	   'django.contrib.sites',
                   'gift-registry',
        	   ...
               )
        
        2. Add a setting to describe your event::
        
               GIFT_REGISTRY_SETTINGS = {
                   'EVENT_NAME': "Alice and Bob's Wedding",
               }
        
        3. Include the gifts URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
               url(r'^gift-registry/', include('gift_registry.urls')),
        
        4. Run `python manage.py syncdb` to create the Gift Registry models.
        
        5. Start the development server and visit
           http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/gift_registry/gift/ to add gift ideas.
        
        6. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/gift-registry/ to browse the public list.
        
        
        Customising
        -----------
        
        There's a good chance that you'll want to customise the look and feel. You do
        this by overriding the built-in templates.
        
        Add your own template directory to settings.TEMPLATE_DIRS and override the base
        template here. To do this, first create a "gift_registry" directory in your
        templates directory. Then from within the django-gift-registry package, copy
        "gift_registry/templates/gift_registry/base.html" into your newly created
        "gift_registry" directory. Customise this base.html file with your own HTML and
        CSS.
