        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        - asyncio: It requires the asyncio library for event handling. This means it
          will also require Python 3.3, but Python 3.4 is recommended. (At least the Hg
          version of 10/01/2014 required.)
        - pyte: A python library for handling vt100 escape codes.
