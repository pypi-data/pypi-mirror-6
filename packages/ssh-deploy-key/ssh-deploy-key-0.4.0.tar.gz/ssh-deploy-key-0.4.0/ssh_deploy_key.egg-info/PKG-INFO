        SSH Deploy Key
        ===================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        SSH Deploy key is a simple to use, high-performance tool
        to distribute your ssh public key to one or more remote servers.
        It can be used interactively, or it can be scripted
        using standard shell redirection techniques.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        Documentation and example usage can be found at
        
        http://ssh-deploy-key.readthedocs.org/
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        SSH deploy key is installed from the command line with pip.
        
        On some systems, there are development packages that must be
        installed first.
        
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        ssh-deploy-key depends on the excellent Paramiko ssh library, which
        requires the Python sources.  You can install these
        using the normal package managers for your OS.
        
        **Debian/Ubuntu (apt-get)**
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install python-dev
        
        
        **Red Hat/Centos (yum)**
        
        ::
        
            sudo yum install python-devel
        
        **OS X**
        
        
        You will need a compiler installed -- either XCode or gcc.  Normally, you can
        just run the pip command to install ssh-deploy-key (see below), and if no 
        compiler is available on your system, you will be prompted to install one:
        
        .. image:: http://ssh-deploy-key.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/install_gcc_mac.png
        
        If this happens, click the 'install' button, then run the pip
        command again.
        
        
        Install ssh-deploy-key via Pip
        ------------------------------
        
        Once the development libraries are in place, the best way to
        install ssh-deploy-key is via pip.  To get pip, see
        http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html
        
        Then,
        ::
        
            sudo pip install ssh-deploy-key
        
        
        
        Source Code
