dbfread - Python library for reading data from DBF files
=========================================================

Requires Python 2.7 or 3.2.

License: MIT

Latest version of the source code: http://github.com/olemb/dbfread/


Example
-------

::

    >>> import dbfread
    >>> table = dbfread.read('people.dbf')

    >>> for rec in table:
    ...     print(rec['NAME'], rec['BIRTHDAY'])
    Alice 1987-03-01
    Bob 1980-11-12
    
    >>> for rec in table:
    ...     print(rec)
    {u'NAME' : u'Alice', u'BIRTHDAY' : datetime.date(1987, 3, 1)}
    {u'NAME' : u'Bob', 'uBIRTHDAY' : datetime.date(1980, 11, 12)}


All records will be read into memory. The Table class is a subclass of
list, so you can use all the normal list operations on it.

Deleted records are available in ``table.deleted``.


Status
------

This code in various incarnations has been in production at the
University of TromsÃ¸ since 2001. The current version reads all data
generated by Telemator (http://www.telemator.no/), which uses Visual
Foxpro (as far as I can tell) and employs a wide range of data types.

The library has not been widely tested on other data, but I intend for
it to be able to read any DBF file. If you have a file it can't read,
or find a bug, I'd love to hear from you.


Installing
----------

Python 2::

  sudo python setup.py install

Python 3::

  sudo python3 setup.py install
    

Supported field types

0  flags       int
C  text        unicode string
D  date        datetime.date or None
F  float       float or None
I  integer     int or None
L  logical     True, False or None
M  memo        unicode string (memo) or byte string (picture or object)
N  numeric     int, float or None

Options
-------

By default, dbfread will try to guess the character encoding from the
language_driver byte. If it can't guess the encoding it uses
"latin1". You can override the encoding with the option::

   encoding='latin1'

You can lower field names with ``lowernames=True``::

    >>> table = dbfread.read('people.dbf',
                             lowernames=True)
    >>> for rec in table:
    ...     print(rec['name'], rec['birthday'])

The ``recfactory`` option takes any callable which accepts a list of
```(name, value)``` tuples, for example::

   recfactory=collections.OrderedDict

One last option. By default, dbfread will assume that you've copied the
DBF files from a windows file system, and that the file name casing is
all scrambled. Thus, it will treat ```People.FPT``` as the same file
as ```PEOPLE.fpt```. You can turn off this behaviour with::

   ignorecase=False

There is also an "undocumented" option, which I use mostly for debugging::

   raw=True   # Returns all data values as raw bytestrings


Table attributes
----------------

The table object has a lot of attributes that can be useful for
introspection. Some simple ones::

    >>> table.name
    'people'
    
    >>> table.date
    datetime.date(2012, 7, 11)

    >>> table.encoding
    'cp1252'

A list of field names can be used for producing CSV files, for example::

    >>> table.field_names
    [u'NAME', u'BIRTHDAY']

The file header and field headers are namedtuples::

    >>> table.header
    DBFHeader(dbversion=48, year=12, month=7, day=11, numrecords=555,
    headerlen=2408, recordlen=632, reserved1=0, incomplete_transaction=0,
    encryption_flag=0, free_record_thread=0, reserved2=0, reserved3=0,
    mdx_flag=3, language_driver=3, reserved4=0)
    
    >>> table.fields
    [DBFField(name=u'NAME', type=u'C', address=1, length=25, decimal_count=0,
    reserved1=0, workarea_id=0, reserved2=0, reserved3=0, set_fields_flag=0,
    reserved4='\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00', index_field_flag=0),
    ... etc. ...]


dbf2sqlite
-----------

A tool is included in the ```examples``` directory to convert DBF into
sqlite, for example::

    dbf2sqlite -o stamnett.sqlite kabreg.dbf endreg.dbf

This will create one table for each DBF file. You can also omit the
``-o stamnett.sqlite`` option to have the SQL printed directly to
stdout.
