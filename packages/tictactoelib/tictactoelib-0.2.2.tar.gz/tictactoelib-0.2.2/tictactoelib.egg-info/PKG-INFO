Description: Game Logic for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
        ===================================
        
        This library allows to easily create front-ends for ultimate-tic-tac-toe game.
        It takes care of game rules, validating the arguments, calling the right
        functions.
        
        ``run.lua`` is an example how this library can be used. To try out::
        
            tictactoelib/run.lua \
                tictactoelib/examples/dumb_player.lua \
                tictactoelib/examples/dumb_player.lua
        
        The file takes two arguments: Lua files, which implement a player.
        ``tictactoelib/examples/dumb_player.lua`` is a demo player which marks a first
        available slot.  Command-line example above makes it fight with itself.
        
        See comments in ``tictactoelib/examples/dumb_player.lua`` how to implement a
        player (it could also be something that takes events from UI).
        
        For human-readable game rules, see ultimate-tic-tac-toe's website_.
