Testing and documentation
=========================

The short version: use tox_.

The long version: see the extra notes for merlyn_.

Changelog
=========

0.1.0
-----

Huge improvements to test suite. Also added support for creating
credentials, so you can actually use stanczyk and only stanczyk
without ever having to touch any internals yourself.

0.0.2
-----

A much nicer version you can actually play around with.

- stanczyk is now continuously tested, thanks to Travis CI. Coverage
  is measured thanks to Coveralls.
- Solution notification: when an exercise is solved, stanczyk will say
  something.
- Exercise listing and exercise details listing commands.
- Proxy commands. You can now connect to remote virtual servers.
- Nicer terminal line overwriting routines, which makes it less
  obvious that stuff is happening asynchronously (sometimes).
- When starting, a nice table is displayed with all of the available
  commands, plus a short description of what they do.

I've made a `short video <http://youtu.be/W_jEIvugwes>`_ that roughly
coincides with this version.

0.0.1
-----

Initial version. Contains a nice basic manhole with no extra commands.

Name and spelling
=================

``stanczyk`` is named after `Stańczyk`_, a historical Polish jester.
Other Crypto 101 projects (such as merlyn_, arthur_ and clarent_) were
already named after things from the court of Arthurian legend; I
picked Stańczyk because:

1. Poland is awesome.
2. This project looks simple, but it's actually pretty clever; perhaps
   more than its peers.
3. Poland is awesome.

The banner is an excerpt from the famous painting of Stańczyk by `Jan
Matejko`_.
