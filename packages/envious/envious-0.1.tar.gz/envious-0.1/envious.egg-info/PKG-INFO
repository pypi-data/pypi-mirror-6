Description: Envious: Unleash the power of .env files
        ========================================
        
        If you spend a lot of time switching between multiple Python projects and using
        several virtual environment, you'll be familiar with the pain of injecting the
        right environment variables into your scripts. You can use autoenv, but it
        doesn't automatically load the virtual environment for you, so you need to
        litter the .env file with bash commands. Or you can use a postactivate hook in
        virtualenvwrapper, but that would mean not having a standardized,
        default location for all the needed environment variables. And what if you use
        an IDE like PyCharm, which doesn't load variables from .env files?
        
        Envious solves the problem by loading configurations from an .env file in the
        working directory directly from within your Python code, injecting environment
        variables if they're not already defined, while keeping those that are already
        set.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install envious, simply type:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install envious
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To have your project import environment variables from an .env file, first
        create the file in the root folder of your project:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            ENVIRONMENT=development
            MONGODB_URL=http://localhost:27017/mydb
            REDIS_URL=http://localhost:6379/0
        
        Then add the following to the Python app entry point:
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
            from envious import load_env
        
            load_env()
