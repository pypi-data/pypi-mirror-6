**1.3** (2012-05-01)
====================

    * Cleaned up documentation.

    * Redid css layouts.
      Cloud now has three layouts, controlled by css media queries:

        - "Normal" mode displays the document as a center-aligned
          box within the browser window. It will not grow
          to be larger than ``max_width`` (default 11 inches) in size.
          (This theme parameter was previously named ``docwidth``).

        - "Compact" mode strips the body padding to fill the whole window,
          but otherwise looks "Normal" mode. It will be used
          when the browser is less than ``compact_width`` (default 960 pixels)
          in size. This layout is new in 1.3.

        - "Minimal" mode strips excess padding, hides the sidebar,
          and does other things to reduce it's footprint as much as possible.
          This mode will be used if the browser is less than
          ``minimal_width`` in size (currently 700px), or if it
          uses the ``"handheld"`` css media type.
          (This theme parameter was previously named ``smallwidth``).

    * Added :mod:`~cloud_sptheme.ext.issue_tracker` extension,
      for auto-creating links to a project's issue tracker.

    * Added :mod:`~cloud_sptheme.ext.escaped_samp_literals` extension,
      which patches Sphinx to allow literal ``{`` characters in *samp* roles.

    * Added optional Google Analytics integration.

    * Added ``collapsiblesidebar`` option, as well as ``defaultcollapsed`` option.
      Though sidebar is still always hidden under minimal mode.

    * Added a number of other ``rst-class`` styling directives.
