Working With Django TastyPie
============================

dRest includes an API specifically built for the 
`Django TastyPie <http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/>`_ API framework.  
It handles auto-detection of resources, and their schema, as well as
other features to support the interface including getting resource data
by 'resource_uri'.
