Tastypie Crust
==============

Your Tastypie just become even tastier.


+++++++++
Rationale
+++++++++

This package is really just a collection of snippets I use constantly with
Tastypie across multiple projects. They are reused so much it just makes more
sense to collect them together than copy-pasting codes everywhere.

None of the snippets in this package originate from myself. The idea of
"resource actions", in particular, came from `tastypie-actions`_ by Justin
Alexander (*aka* thelonecabbage_ on GitHub), although I re-implemented the
details quite a bit. Some other utilities are mostly collected from snippets
floating around the Internet (StackOverflow_, `djangosnippets.org`_, etc.).

making those methods accessible throught Tastypie API.

    action(name=None, url=None, static=False,
           allowed=None, login_required=False)

Decorator that makes extra resource methods accessible through Tastypie API.

::

    class AnonymousAuthentication

anonymously.
