Introduction
============

This library packages `Video.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Video.js`: http://www.videojs.com/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.videojs``) are published to some URL.
