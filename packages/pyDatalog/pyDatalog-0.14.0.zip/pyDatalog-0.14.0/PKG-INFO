Description: pyDatalog adds the logic Programming paradigm to Python's toolbox, in a pythonic way.
        
        Logic programmers can now use the extensive standard library of Python, and Python programmers can now express complex algorithms simply.  
        
        Datalog is a truly declarative language derived from Prolog, with strong academic foundations.  It complements Python very well for:
        
        * managing complex sets of related information (e.g. in data integration or the semantic web).  
        * simulating intelligent behavior (e.g. in games or expert systems), 
        * performing recursive algorithms (e.g. in network protocol, code and graph analysis)
        * solving discrete constraint problems. 
        
        In particular, pyDatalog can be used as a query language: 
        
        * it can perform multi-database queries (from memory datastore, 11 relational databases, and noSQL database with appropriate connectors)
        * it is more expressive than SQL, with a cleaner syntax; 
        * it facilitates re-use of SQL code snippet (e.g. for frequent joins or formula); 
        
        Datalog excels at managing complexity.  Datalog programs are often shorter than their Python equivalent, 
        and Datalog statements can be specified in any order, as simply as formula in a spreadsheet.
