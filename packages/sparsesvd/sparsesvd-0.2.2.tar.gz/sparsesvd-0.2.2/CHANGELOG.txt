0.1.5

* fixed a bug deep inside SVDLIBC, where a global error flag was not being reset
  before: zero input matrix=>global error flag set + memory leak + all subsequent calls to sparsesvd() terminate early
  now: the error flag is reset before each call; zero input matrix correctly returns zero factors

  thanks to Peter Prettenhofer for reporting the bug
