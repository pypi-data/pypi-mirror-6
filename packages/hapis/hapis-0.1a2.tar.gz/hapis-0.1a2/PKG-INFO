Description: Overview
        ========
        
        hapis is a collection of packages that help with creating plugins for Pyramid
        web framework.
        
        Each subpackage aims to make work on a certain aspect of an application more
        convenient, some also serve as mediators between plugins and Pyramid.
        
        The hapis package itself does not provide lots of useful functionality but
        includes helper functions that could be used by subpackages. At the time of this
        writing, these helper functions only include those for parsing complex settings
        values.
