Description: About
        ==================================================
        
        ccpages is a lightweight pages application.
        
        Requirements
        --------------------------------------------
        
        - `Django`_ > 1.4
        - `mptt`_
        - `Markdown2`_
        - `ccfiletypes`_
        
        Markdown, django-mptt and ccfiletypes will be installed if you don't already have them.
        
        Quick Installation Instructions
        --------------------------------------------
        
        Install ccpages::
        
            pip install django-ccpages
        
        
        Next add `ccpages` & `MPTT` to your installed apps::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                 ...
                'ccpages',
                'mptt',
            )
        
        
        `ccpages` requires `ccfiletypes`_ and django-writingfield these will be installed with pip. Make
        sure that `ccfiletypes`_ is also in your installed apps. It only needs to be
        once::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                 ...
                'ccfiletypes',
                'writingfield',
            )
        
        Wire it up to your root urls.py::
        
            urlpatterns += ('',
            ...
                ('^pages/', include('ccpages.urls', namespace='ccpages')),
            )
        
        Then run syncdb::
        
            python manage.py syncdb
        
        
        Finally you'll need to run the collectstatic command to get all of the static
        files into your static root::
        
            python manage.py collectstatic

        Features
        ==================================================
        
        Password protected pages
        ----------------------------
        
        Pages can be password protected with a password. The password is stored in
        plain text and this mechanism is not meant to store highly sensitive
        information. It is merely intended to provide a means of allowing a group of
        people access to content without having a dependancy on user authentication.
