Description: ==================
        Silva News Network
        ==================
        
        Silva is a Zope-based web application designed for the creation and
        management of structured, textual content. Silva allows users to enter
        new documents as well as edit existing documents using a web
        interface.
        
        Silva News Network is an extension to Silva to allow authors to place
        articles and agendaitems on the Silva site and show them on a page.
        
        There are versions for older Silva versions available for download as
        well.  No other products are required to use Silva News Network from
        Silva, besides the products required to run Silva itself.
        
        
        Using Silva News Network
        ========================
        
        The first thing to do is add subjects and target audiences to the
        service_news object in the Silva root in the ZMI. This object is used
        only to manage those lists (subjects and target audiences), these will
        function as criteria for the newsfilters (more on these later in this
        document) to search on. It would be best to add as much subjects and
        target audiences as currently available to the service when setting up
        News, since the lists are the basis of the filtering system and one
        has to dive into the ZMI to add items (therefore it requires
        appropriate rights to edit stuff in the ZMI).  Managing these lists is
        quite straightforward: you can add an item by filling in a string into
        one of the textfields and pressing on the corresponding 'add' button,
        and remove them by checking the checkbox in front of an item and
        clicking the corresponding 'remove' button.
        
        Adding a News Publication
        -------------------------
        
        Newsitems can only be added to newspublication. To add one, go to the
        SMI and choose 'Silva News Publication' from the menu of addables
        (upper left corner of the edit tab in folders, publications and the
        Silva root). Enter an id and a title and choose 'Add and edit', you
        will then be taken to the edit tab of the newspublication.  This tab
        looks a lot like the edit tab of other containers (folders,
        publications) in Silva, except it doesn't have a default document or
        view and can not contain anything other then news items (articles and
        agenda items), folders and publications (thus allowing a more
        structured setup of the newspublication).You can add newsitems by
        choosing a specific type from the addables menu in this tab.
        
        Properties tab
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In the properties tab of newspublication there is a checkbox called
        'restrict access'. When this is checked, the folder can only be found
        by news- and agendafilters in the same folder the folder is on and
        each subfolder of that folder. This can be used to make the
        newspublication 'private', making it available only to for example 1
        department.
        
        Adding news items
        -----------------
        
        Now authors can add newsitems. As stated before, there are two types
        of newsitems: articles and agendaitems. The main differences are that
        agendaitems must contain a date/time on which the event described in
        them takes place, and contain a location on which the event takes
        place. The start date/time is necessary to show the items in
        agendaviewers, since they show the items for a particular period
        (e.g. a month). Therefore agendaviewers can show only
        agendaitems. Newsviewers are capable of showing both articles and
        agendaitems. Other datafields required for the system to work
        correctly are 'subjects' and 'target audiences', which the author can
        use to classify the newsitem. These fields will later be used by the
        newsfilters as criteria for routing the items to newsviewers. When
        editing an article or agenda item, keep in mind that the first heading
        placed in the content editor is considered to be the subheader of the
        newsitem, and the first paragraph as the lead (both will show up in
        the preview on the viewers).
        
        Adding news filters
        -------------------
        
        The next thing to do to make the system work is adding one or more
        news- and agendafilters. These are objects used by editors or chief-
        editors to filter a stream of newsitems. The items can be filtered on
        subject and target audience (so for instance a newsfilter can route
        only newsitems with a specific subject or meant for a specific target
        audience to the viewers) and/or individually (per newsitem). Another
        feature of the filters is the ability to 'stick to the current path',
        when set this makes the filters pick up items only if they're in a
        subdirectory of the filter's container.
        
        The Filters' edit tab
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The contents tab of a newsfilter shows a list of all available
        newspublications (excluding the ones made private by checking the
        'restrict access' checkbox that are not in the same folder or a
        parentfolder of the newsfilter). To route newsitems of a
        newspublication to newsviewers (more about those later) make sure the
        checkbox in front of the newspublication is checked and click the
        'update sources' button. All (published) newsitems that conform to the
        criteria of the newsfilter will then be routed to the newsviewers that
        use this filter. These criteria can be set in the 'Properties' tab of
        the newsfilter: you see the lists of subjects and target audiences of
        service_news again, and in newsfilters also a couple of radiobuttons
        to select whether the filter should route agendaitems as well as
        articles. These criteria can be used to distribute articles and
        agendaitems in different ways across the Silva instance to
        newsviewers.
        
        For example: a number of different newspublications can contain both
        articles and agendaitems of different subjects and targeting different
        audiences, and the newsfilters filter and distribute specific items to
        viewers. Please note that this means that filters must be sensibly set
        up for the site to allow all newsitems to be shown somewhere: it is
        very easy to set up the system in a way that articles and agendaitems
        with a specific subject or target audience are filtered out by all
        newsfilters, and therefore be excluded from all viewers.
        
        The Items tab
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The 'Items' tab can be used to filter out specific items, to allow
        editors and chiefeditors to disallow specific articles and agendaitems
        to be routed by a filter. To filter out a specific item, uncheck the
        checkbox in front of it and choose 'update'.
        
        Now the news- and agendaviewers can be placed. The viewers are the
        objects responsible for showing the articles and agendaitems to the
        public. An author can place viewers where he wants news to be shown.
        The viewers show a list of items routed by the filters.
        
        The Viewer's Edit tab
        ---------------------
        
        The viewers are quite easy to set up: the only tab that matters is the
        first one (edit), where you can set the number of days the viewer will
        look back (for newsviewers) or ahead (for agendaviewers) to get
        items. In the case of newsviewers there is also a switch to choose a
        number of items to be shown. Also there is a list of available
        filters. All filters chosen here are used for retrieving news. When
        placed, the viewers will be available to the public and show articles
        and/or agendaitems, together with an archive (that allows showing
        items for a particular month) and a search option.
        
        Appending /rss to the URL of a NewsViewer will show the RSS 1.0 (RDF
        compliant) view of the items in this viewer.
        
        The RSSAggregator
        -----------------
        
        The RSSAggregator replaces the old (and now removed) RSSViewer. In the
        tab_edit you'll see a textbox called 'RSS feeds' where you can enter
        the complete URLs for the feeds you want to have merged by this
        aggregator instance.
        
        All the other functionality is the same as for News Viewers.

        New Features
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - First release for Silva 2.2, no longer backwards compatible
          with prior Silva releases
        
        - News and Agenda Viewers now have a "Year Range" property which
          controls the number of years in the past and future wich are
          displayed in the archive.  Attempts to access years outside
          of this range will raise 404's.
        
        - SilvaNews has popup calendars for start/end datetimes in the SMI
        
        - SilvaNews no longer manages it's own upgraders.  Upgrading SilvaNews
          is now tied into the core Silva upgrade process.
        
        New Features ported from SNN 2.7.6
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - removing '<<' and '>>' from links and putting the the html
          entities in a span
        - adding wrappers for the news and agenda archive content area
        - adding a vertical separator between months
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed issue that made that broken images in news items resulted in
          failing searches.
        
        - Added 'unblock' css class to viewer field iterators so links render
          properly (resulting from removal of the sortable id/class)
        
        - correct localization datetime issues with rssaggregator's rss/atom feeds
          and inlineviewer newsprovider.
        
        - AgendaViewers were pulling the latest number of items, rather
          than all items in X days.
        
        - Update last author when an article/agenda item is saved in kupu.
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7.5 (2009-03-26)
        -----------------------------------
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The 'publish now' button in the edit tab of news items raised a 404
          when clicked, and it wasn't translated.
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7.4 (2009-03-05)
        -----------------------------------
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The rss.xml feed on news and agenda viewers did not validate against
          the rss 1.0 specification
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7.3 (2009/02/19)
        -----------------------------------
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The 'publish now' button for news and agenda items was not
          setting the display date time.  The result was that new items
          would not be found by filters
        
        - removed the SNN 2.6 upgrader (which refreshes the catalog).
          All news items do need to be reindexed.  To do this, use the
          "Partial catalog rebuilds" tab of the Silva Extensions Service
          (in the ZMI) to rebuild each Silva News Publication.
        
        - Added a dummy upgrader for SNN 2.7, so it appears that
          the upgrade upgrades to 2.7
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7.2 (2009/02/12)
        -----------------------------------

          and added additional css classes
        
        - rss aggregator public view: adjusted feed link to be the
          html link, rather than the uri of the syndication feed
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7.1 (2009/02/11)
        -----------------------------------
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - changed the viewer public language back so that translations
          work.
        
        - Added 'unblock' css class to viewer field iterators so links render
          properly (resulting from removal of the sortable id/class)
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 2.7
        --------------------
        
        New Features
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The RSS Aggregator now merges/sorts the feeds based on each
          feed item's publication date.
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The AgendaViewer displays the same number of characters
          for each item's intro as NewsViewers do (i.e. 128)
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 2.6
        --------------------
        
        New Features
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Moved the "new version" button in the editor screen below the
          feedback text, as opposed to nestled in the corner next to the
          text. This because a Silva trainer reported that a trainee
          couldn't figure out how to make a new version. Now it's more
          obvious, hopefully enough.
        
        - added the end date/time and location properties of Agenda
          Items to the agenda item add screen.
        
        - added the location property of Agenda Items to the public view
        
        - working with Zope 2.10 (ala merge 2.4-zope-2.10-branch)
        
        - registering content via 'silva' zcml directives
        
        - worked up SilvaNews interfaces a bit
        
        - Added a SilvaNewsCategoryFilter asset, which can be used to
          limit the category lists in Filters and the properties tool in
          the News Item editor.
        
        - refactored the viewers, merging shared code
        
        - Added metadata columns for frequently accessed newsitem data
          (including get_intro!)
        
        - Refactored News/Agenda viewers:
        
          1. to use new metadata columns
        
          2. each of the three public views (standard, archive, search)
             uses a shared macro to render the items, ensuring consistent
             display between all three views.
        
        - eliminated all calls to getObject() (catalogbrain) in the
          filters -- since it's a "slow" operation, the cases where this
          was required are now using the additional catalog metadata
          columns.
        
        - Added rss.xml and atom.xml views, based on the Silva 2.0
          rss.xml Container view.  These use the framework laid out for
          container rss, and include extra tags for silvanews specific
          metadata (location, start,end dates)
        
        - rss.xml and atom.xml also work for RSSAggregator
        
        - Removed XMLBuffer, as it is no longer used
        
        - added interfaces INewsViewer and IAgendaViewer. These
          interfaces can be used by SilvaLayout/Five to provide special
          views for news/agenda viewers.
        
        - InlineNewsViewer was updated with some Z3 features, e.g. using
          the Z3 interface lookup.
        
        - The default INV formulator form and view templates have new
          features including: containing div id and class, showing a
          search box, specifying article level, optional image
          thumbnail, where and whether to place links to articles, and
          possible a few others.  If you're using the default INV, you
          should refresh the template by going to the each INV's url and
          adding '/refresh', e.g. http://server.com/silva/inv/refresh
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Changed the new version button in the editor screen from an
          input to a button, to avoid css conflicts with frontend.css
          controls styles
        
        - 176581: removed Category Filter preview tab, and registered a
          "dummy" public view for this content type
        
        - 160505: SNN News Publications cannot have addables settings.
          It should, being News Publications inherit from Publications.
        
        - viewers displayed items in reverse order when using multiple
          filters
        
        - Improved (simplified the css of) the properties toolbox layout
        
        - fix for broken rss feed caused by get_intro() not getting the
          model
        
        - using 'get_intro' for RSS feeds introduced a bug in at least
          some RSS feeds. This has been worked around.
        
        - fix in NewsFilter.get_next_items, to catch _all_ agenda item
          cases
        
        - Publishing using the "publish now" button on the edit tab for
          news items was slightly broken.  The resultant page returned
          after this action had a <base> tag set to the news item
          version instead of the news item itself, breaking navigation
          links.
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 2.5.1

        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        - Reworked public templates: removed divs and replaced by p's with Silva
          style plus news selectors, indenting, language
        
        - Made layout of the INV (Inline News Viewer) more generic using standard
          Silva html classes
        
        - Fixed space above kupu more robustly, so other extensions can control
          the feedback space too.
        
        - RSS Aggregator public view: removed hard coded table and replaced with
          standard Silva html rendering

        Features

          to Marc Petitmermet.
        
        - Added dummy upgrader for 1.2, which makes that the upgrades are
          actually ran when the data version is 1.2 (works around a bug in
          Silva's upgrade registry).
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 2.0.1
        ----------------------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added missing upgraders for 1.3 (or below) to 2.0.
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 2.0
        --------------------
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        - Kupu editor support for news items (replacing the widget editor)
        
        - Name change from SilvaNews to SilvaNewsNetwork
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 1.3
        --------------------
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        - In each item in a news viewer, the first image of the item's content
          (if available) is displayed as a thumbnail.
        
        - Removed all tables from the public views to more easily allow styling
          and layouting with CSS (note that this changes the layout of the public
          views!)
        
        - Added a new checkbox in Agenda Items, 'display time', to control
          whether the time part of start and end date/time is displayed in
          the public views, allowing times of 00:00 to be displayed.
        
        - Added a couple of new fields to service_news to allow displaying
          dates and months in a certain locale and format (this is a global
          setting rather than a per-user one, because Silva content currently
          can not be presented in more than one language it doesn't make sense
          to display dates and months in different languages).
        
        - Added a new field 'display_datetime' to news items, rather than using
          the publication date/time to determine if and where an item is
          displayed in a news viewer, this display date is used, e.g. allowing
          re-publishing of an item without moving it in the public view of news
          viewers.
        
        - Agenda items are now displayed according to the end datetime, if
          available, so that an item disappears from the list of 'current events'
          when it ends rather than when it starts.
        
        - Subjects and target audiences now have a title, which allows changing
          the way they are displayed without having to update stored references
          to them (so you can now 'change a subject' and still have newsviewers
          display the correct list of items).
        
        - Rather than displaying the first subheader encountered in the news item
          and the first paragraph encountered (which enforced a certain structure
          on news item content to make the viewers display the items correctly)
          news viewers now display the first *bit* of the news item, regardless
          of the type of elements that contains. Note that this requires some
          changes in the public templates (the subheader() and lead() methods
          have been replaced by one called 'get_intro').
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The 'number of items to display' field on news viewers used to limit
          the number of items displayed in the archive, which made certain items
          not get displayed anymore, this is not fixed.

        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Changed the names of indexes so they're less likely to clash with
          names of user-generated objects - SEE UPGRADE.txt!
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 1.0
        --------------------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed 'select all' in edit tabs.
        
        - Fixed some small template issues so it works correctly with Silva 1.0.
        
        - Problem in some DateTime argument formatting solved that made viewing
              certain objects result in an IOError when Silva was running on Windows
              Zope installations.
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 0.9.1
        ----------------------
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Silva News really depends on Silva Document, not just Silva core.
        
        SilvaNewsNetwork 0.9

          get the RSS 1.0 feed for this viewer or aggregator.
        
        - Removed the RSSViewer (replaced by the RSSAggregator).
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed just about all Silva 0.9.3 conversion issues.
        
        Note: SilvaNews 0.9 is incompatible with previously released
        versions.
