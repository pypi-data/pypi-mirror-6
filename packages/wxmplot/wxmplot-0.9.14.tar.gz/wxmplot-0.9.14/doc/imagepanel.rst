:class:`ImagePanel`:  A wx.Panel for Image Display
==========================================================

.. module:: imagepanel

The :class:`ImagePanel` class supports image display, including gray-scale
and false-color maps or contour plots for 2-D arrays of intensity.
:class:`ImagePanel` is derived from a :class:`wx.Panel` and so can be
easily included in a wx GUI.

While the image can be customized programmatically, the only interactivity
built in to the :class:`ImagePanel` itself is the ability to zoom in and
out.  In contrast, an :class:`ImageFrame` provides many more ways to
manipulate the displayed image, as will be discussed below.

.. class:: ImagePanel(parent, size=(4.5, 4.0), dpi=100, messenger=None, **kws)

   Create an Image Panel, a :class:`wx.Panel`

   :param parent: wx parent object.
   :param size:   figure size in inches.
   :param dpi:    dots per inch for figure.
   :param messenger: function for accepting output messages.
   :type messenger: callable or ``None``

   The *size*, and *dpi* arguments are sent to matplotlib's
   :class:`Figure`.  The *messenger* should should be a function that
   accepts text messages from the panel for informational display.  The
   default value is to use :func:`sys.stdout.write`.

   Extra keyword parameters are sent to the wx.Panel.

   The configuration settings for an image (its colormap, smoothing,
   orientation, and so on) are controlled through configuration
   attributes.

:class:`ImagePanel` methods
===================================

.. method:: display(data, x=None, y=None, style='image', **kws)

   display a new image from the 2-D numpy array *data*.  If provided, the
   *x* and *y* values will be used as coordinates for the pixels for
   display purposes.


.. method:: clear()

  clear the image

.. method:: redraw()

  redraw the image, as when the configuration attributes have been changed.

:class:`ImagePanel` callback attributes
=========================================

An :class:`ImagePanel` instance has several **callback** attributes that can be used to get information from the
image panel.


.. data:: data_callback

     A function that is called with the data and `x` and `y` values each time :meth:`display` is called.

.. data:: lasso_callback

     A function that is called with the data and selected points when the cursor is in **lasso mode** and a new set of points has been selected.

.. data:: cursor_callback

     A function that is called with the `x` and `y` position clicked on each left-button event.

.. data:: contour_callback

     A function that is called with the contour levels each time :meth:`display` is called with ``style='contour'``.


:class:`ImageFrame`:  A wx.Frame for Image Display
==========================================================

.. module:: imageframe

In addition to providing a top-level window frame holding an
:class:`ImagePanel`, an :class:`ImageFrame` provides the end-user with many ways to
manipulate the image:

   1. display x, y, intensity coordinates (left-click)
   2. zoom in on a particular region of the plot (left-drag).
   3. change color maps.
   4. flip and rotate image.
   5. select optional smoothing interpolation.
   6. modify intensity scales.
   7. save high-quality plot images (as PNGs), copy to system clipboard, or print.

These options are all available programmatically as well, by setting the
configuration attributes and redrawing the image.


.. class:: ImageFrame(parent, size=(550, 450), **kws)

   Create an Image Frame, a :class:`wx.Frame`.  This is a Frame with an
   :class:`ImagePanel` and several menus and controls for changing the color table and
   smoothing options as well as switching the display style between "image" and "contour".


Image configuration with :class:`ImageConfig`
==============================================================

To change any of the attributes of the image on an :class:`ImagePanel`, you
can set the corresponding attribute of the panel's :attr:`conf`.   That is,
if you create an :class:`ImagePanel`, you can set the colormap with::

    import matplotlib.cm as cmap
    im_panel = ImagePanel(parent)
    im_panel.display(data_array)

    # now change colormap:
    im_panel.conf.cmap = cmap.cool
    im_panel.redraw()

    # now rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise):
    im_panel.conf.rot = True
    im_panel.redraw()

    # now flip the image (top/bottom), apply log-scaling,
    # and apply gaussian interpolation
    im_panel.conf.flip_ud = True
    im_panel.conf.log_scale = True
    im_panel.conf.interp = 'gaussian'
    im_panel.redraw()

For a :class:`ImageFrame`, you can access this attribute as *frame.panel.conf.cmap*.

The list of configuration attributes and their meaning are given in the
:ref:`Table of Image Configuration attributes <imageconf_table>`

.. _imageconf_table:

Table of Image Configuration attributes:  All of these are members of the
*panel.conf* object, as shown in the example above.

Some notes:

1. *cmap* is an instance of a matplotlib colormap.
2. *cmap_lo* and *cmap_hi* set the low and high values for the sliders that compress the
   colormap, and are on a scale from 0 to 100.
3. In contrast, *int_lo* and *int_hi* set the map intensity values that are used when
   *auto_intensity* is ``False``.  These can be used to put two different maps on the
   same intensity intensity scale.

Examples and Screenshots
====================================================================

Basic example
--------------

A basic plot from a :class:`ImageFrame` looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/image.py

giving the following image:


.. image:: images/imagedisplay.png
   :width: 85%

This screenshot shows a long list of choices for color table, a checkbox to
reverse the color table, sliders to adjust the upper and lower level, and
entries to explicitly set the minimum and maximum intensity.  


Clicking on the image will show its coordinates and intensity value.
Click-and-Drag will select a rectangular box to zoom in on a particular
feature of the image.

The File menu includes options to save an PNG file of the image (Ctrl-S),
copy the image to the system clipboard (Ctrl-C), print (Ctrl-P) or
print-preview the image, save the image to an ASCII file (table of
numbers), or quit the application.

The Options menu includes Zoom Out (Ctrl-Z), rotating the image clockwise
(Ctrl-R), flipping the image top/bottom (Ctrl-T) or right/left (Ctrl-F)
(note that flipping does not work for contour-style plots) or saving an
image of the colormap.


The Contrast menu lets you toggle a log intensity scale (Ctrl-L), or
enhance the contrast (Ctrl-E).  The Smoothing menu allows you choose from
one of several interpolation algorithms.

Contour Example
---------------

From the Options menu, one can toggle to a 'contour style' plot, in which
the levels are made discrete with many fewer levels than the continuous
image display.  A contour plot can be created like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/image.py 

giving a plot that would look like this:

.. image:: images/contour.png
   :width: 85%

In addition, one can bring up a screen to set the number of contour levels.

3-Color Example
-----------------

If the data array has three dimensions, and has a shape of (NY, NX, 3), it
is assumed to be a 3 color map, holding Red, Green, and Blue intensities.
In this case, the Image Frame will show sliders and min/max controls for
each of the three colors.  For example:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/rgb_image.py 

giving a plot that would look like this:

.. image:: images/image_3color.png
   :width: 85%


Note that there is also a selection for the *Zero Intensity Color' which
can either be 'black' or 'white'.   The same image with a white background
looks like: 


.. image:: images/image_3color_white.png
   :width: 85%


This gives a slightly different view of the same data, and the images may be
more suitable for printed documents and presentations.
