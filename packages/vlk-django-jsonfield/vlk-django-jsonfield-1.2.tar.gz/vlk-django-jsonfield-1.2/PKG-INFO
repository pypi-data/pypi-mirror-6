Description: VLK JSONField
        =============
        
        A model JSONField with an integrated form for django.
        
        Before doing this app we looked up for a JSONField implementation, but all that we have found had nothing that fit our needs. Our needs are just a model field to store a json string and a form that is able to validate user input against our json fields requirements.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Just copy this project to any folder in your computer or use pip.
        
            pip install vlk-django-jsonfield
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ### Model
        
        To create your JSONField just use the same notation as an usual model field:
        
            jsonfield = VLKJSONField(null=True, default=lambda: {'field1': False, 'field2': 'abc'})
        
        [You must use lambda when using a dict as default] (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#default)
        
        ### Form
        
        To use this field in a form just use the form field with the same name of your model field and the subname separated by `__`:
        
            jsonfield__field1 = forms.CharField()
            jsonfield__field2 = forms.IntegerField(required=False)
        
        The right side is the usual of a form field.
