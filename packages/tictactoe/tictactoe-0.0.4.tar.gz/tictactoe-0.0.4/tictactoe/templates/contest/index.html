<h1>Who’s the Ultimate Gamesmaster?</h1>

After hours of hard work, it’s time for some serious fun. This is the challenge
that separates the men from the boys. Think you can cut it against your fellow
nerds to win the title of Ultimate Gamesmaster? Sign yourself up to the
tournament and get ready to rumble.

<h1>What’s the tournament?</h1>

Ever played tic-tac-toe? Pretty simple, right? Not this one. This tic-tac-toe
is bigger, tougher, and has a lot more at stake. Exclusively for BOI2014
Olympiad, this board is an extended 9x9 grid.  Your challenge is to program
solutions, in real time, that win you the game. If you’re good, you’ll go all
the way to the finals to compete for the title of Ultimate Gamesmaster.

<h1>What can I win?</h1>

You mean, besides the prestige?? This ultimate challenge is about kudos:
respect, fame, fortune, envy… Except for these things, there’s also some cool
prizes up for grabs: Your first victory comes against an example program. This
program plays by the rules, but doesn’t think much. Source code is available.
What you win: a high-quality Spil Games summer cap.  At the end of the
Olympiad, your win-loss record will be analyzed against those of your
opponents. The top 5 players will be crowned Ultimate Gamesmaster. What you
win: a Limited Edition Holy-Cow t-shirt. This designates you as a programming
Guru, a warrior on the path to code enlightenment.

<h1>When does it run?</h1>
The contest opens at 10:00 CEST on 2014-04-26 and closes at 16:00 on
2014-04-29. Winners will be awarded at the closing event, held at 19:00 on
2014-04-29.

<h1>How do I get access?</h1>
Your username and password are the same as of your practice session.

If you cannot login or have questions, it is best to grab me (Motiejus Jakštys)
and we will resolve it together. My picture is in the Technical committee's
list in your Programme which you received in the first day. In case you were
running around for half-day in vain, write an email to: <a
