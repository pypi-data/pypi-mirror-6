# Introduction

This library is intended to provide an open source Python package for calculating the carbon footprint of transport (UK-focused to begin with).

##Documentation
See the documentation for the latest build at [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transport-carbon).

##Contributing
Please contact Jamie Bull at jamie.bull@oco-carbon.com if you would like to assist in developing this package

####ToDo list
1. Add other years to the database. Data for 2012 is available in the same format and so should be easy to add. Other years may be more difficult.
2. Create public functions which link distance and carbon calculations. The intended syntax is `travel_carbon.travel_carbon(origin, destination, mode, **kwargs)`
3. Create the `sea_distance()` function. Some thought has gone into this so please contact if you would like to contribute.
4. Improve the `rail_distance()` function. A new data source, choosing the start and end station appropriately.
5. Improve test coverage.
