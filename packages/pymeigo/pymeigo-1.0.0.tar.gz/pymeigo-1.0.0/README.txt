the package **pymeigo** is a python package that provides a python interface to the
optimisation tool MEIGOR, which is a R package available at http://www.iim.csic.es/~gingproc/meigo.html. The
original R package provides a scatter search optimisation that is obviously dedicated to the optimisation of R functions. **pymeigo** provides an easy way to use MEIGOR within python so as to optimise python functions as well.
