        Features
        --------
        
        * Adds `List-Unsubscribe` header to the email.
        * Adds a context variable `unsubscribe_url` which can be used to render emails.
        * Provides signals to implement the actual unsubscribe logic.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Install Django Unsubcribe:
        
            pip install django-unsubscribe
        
        Add `unsubscribe` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` settings.
        
            from unsubscribe import UnsubscribableEmailMessage  
            # rest of your code
        
        Add a signal listner for `user_unsubscribe` in your code that contains the logic to unsubsribe a user from the mailing list.
        
        That's it!
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This application is supposed to help at improving the overall quality of the 
        mass e-mails your site sends out by:
        
        1. Creating a simple subclass of `django.core.mail.EmailMultiAlternatives`, which adds a List-Unsubscribe header to the email message and a `render_message` function that is a wrapper to `render_to_string` to add `unsubscribe_url` to the context.
        
        2. Providing a replaceable urlconf and view, which provides a unique url for each user wishing to unsubscribe.
        
        This application does not:
        
        1. Compose, create or mail newsletter e-mails for you. That is up to you.
        
        2. Actually unsubscribe members from your mailing lists. It provides a signal, `unsubscribe.signals.user_unsubscribe`, which you must hook on to to unsubscribe your users.
