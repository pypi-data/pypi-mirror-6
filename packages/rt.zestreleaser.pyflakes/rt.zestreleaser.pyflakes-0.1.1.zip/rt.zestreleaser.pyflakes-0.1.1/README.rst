This is a plugin for `zest.releaser`__ for checking your code against `pyflakes`__ before
making a new release of your code.

__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser
__ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes

It will help you keeping your code clean, but it will **not force** you (as a commit hook will be).
