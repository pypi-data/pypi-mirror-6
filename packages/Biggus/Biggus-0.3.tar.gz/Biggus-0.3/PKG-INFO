        Virtual large arrays and lazy evaluation.
        
        
        Design goals:
        
        - Keep the public interface compact.
        - Leverage standard Python syntax.
        - Avoid overloading behaviour.
        - Mimic NumPy when it doesn't contradict the other goals.
        
        
        Use cases:
        
        1. Extract a lazy subset of a lazy array.
        
        2. Extract a sequence of concrete slices from a lazy array.
        
           - MUST NOT make the full lazy array concrete.
        
        3. Stack a homogenous collection of lazy arrays to create a higher
           dimensional lazy array.
        
        4. Join a collection of compatible lazy arrays to create a larger
           lazy array of the same dimensionality.
