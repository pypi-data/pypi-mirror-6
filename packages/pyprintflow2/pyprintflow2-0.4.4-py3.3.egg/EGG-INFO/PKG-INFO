        This application provides tools to integrate Noosh Online with Canto Cumulus, along with maintaining a JSON based data store of integration objects.
        
        In general, integration calls are made using using REST-like web service calls. The 'requests' python package is used to do all HTTP requests.
        
        The application needs to run with "sudo" to ensure permissions required for file system manipulation apply.
        
        In order to make use of this code for production use, you need various authenticated access tokens and serial numbers to use the various applications. 
        Use of the software on with commercial versions of Noosh Online and/or Canto Cumulus and/or Canto Cumulus basis is considered commercial use. 
        However, the source code can be explored and used on a free basis, and if useful, can be re-factored as required for any development purpose.
