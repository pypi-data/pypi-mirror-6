The issue tracker for Django DINGOS
-----------------------------------

Although django-dingos is generic, in the near future its further development
will occur mostly within the further development of the 
`Django Mantis Cyber-Threat Intelligence Management Framework`_. So,
for the time being, please use
https://github.com/siemens/django-mantis/issues
as issue tracker for bugs, feature requests and other feedback regarding
django-dingos.

Types of Contributions
----------------------


Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at https://github.com/siemens/django-mantis/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues (https://github.com/siemens/django-mantis/issues) for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues (https://github.com/siemens/django-mantis/issues) for features. Anything tagged with "feature"
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Djangos could always use more documentation, whether as part of the 
official Djangos docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/siemens/django-mantis/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)


Get Started!
------------

In your contribution, you may want to either modify/add to existing code
or create a new Django application that interacts with the existing
applications that are part of the Mantis framework.

DINGOS profitted a lot from the advice provided in `Two Scoops of Django`_.
Unless you are an absolute Django expert (and maybe even then), please
read Daniel Greenfield's and Audrey Roy's excellent `Two Scoops of Django`_.
Even though it provides best practices for Django 1.5, most of its
advice is also valid for Django 1.6, and likely to be very relevant
for quite a few minor revisions to come.


Modifying/adding to existing code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's how to set up a repository for local development.

1. Fork the relevant repository repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/<repository>.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv <your_mantis_environment>
    $ cd <repository_folder>
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Now you can make your changes locally.

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Writing your own Django application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do yourself a favor and set up the directory structure of your
Django application in the right way from the very start.
The easiest way to do so is to use Daniel Greenfield's `cookiecutter-djangopackage`_ template
(which uses Audrey Roy's excellent `Cookiecutter`_ for creating the directories): this
layout has a very sensible directory structure  with out-of-the-box configuration of ``setup.py`` for
easy build, submission to PyPi, etc., as well as the start of a Sphinx documentation tree.
Once you have the directory structure created, initialize a fresh git repository with it
and get to work...

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7.
