Description: django-micro-cms
        ================
        
        A micro-CMS for django. A bit like flatpages++.
        
        It is **not** a fully-fledged CMS with online editing and media
        management. All it does is allow you to manage pages and their
        templates and translations in the admin (and display the pages on your
        web site, naturally).
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``django-micro-cms`` has no external dependencies other than Django. It
        was tested against Django 1.6. To install ``django-micro-cms``, simply
        
        ::
           
           pip install django-micro-cms
        
        
        There are two more things you have to do before you can use it on your page.
        
        1. Add ``microcms`` to your installed apps::
        
             INSTALLED_APPS = (
                 [...],
                 'microcms',
             )    
        
        2. Add a URL config for your pages::
        
             urlpatterns = patterns('',
                 url(r'^page(?P<url>/.*)$', 'microcms.views.pages', name='pages'),
                 url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
             )
        
           You can add more than one URL config for your pages, but all pages
           will be available at each endpoint.
        
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Using ``django-micro-cms`` is quite simple: create templates, create
        content, see it on the page. That's all. All of the editing is done in
        the Django admin.
        
        
        Templates
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        First you have to create one or more ``Template`` objects. These
        templates will be rendered when you display a page with it. They can
        ``{% extend %}`` pages from your Django web-page, which is a good idea
        if you have a base template, but they cannot themselves be
        ``extend``-ed.
        
        Inside the template, you can use several variables to insert your
        content:
        
        ``title``
          The page title as a safe string.
        
        ``content``
          The page content as a safe string.
        
        ``CONTENT_LANGUAGE_CODE``
          The language code of the loaded content. This may be different from
          the language code of the *page*, because the language code of the
          page depends on the user preferences *and* the page URL (see below
          for details on language-loading). However, the language code of the
          content depends on the availability of content in that language. If
          no content in the requested language is available, the fallback
          language is used and that language code will be indicated here.
        
        ``created``
          The date/time of the page creation.
        
        ``last_modified``
          The date/time of the last modification of the page content.
        
          
        Content
        ~~~~~~~
        
        The second step is to create pages and content for them. Pages have a
        ``URL`` and a ``title``. The URL is the part of the page URL that
        get's parsed out as the view parameter in your URL definition. So if
        you have a page with ``/about/`` as URL and in your URL definition
        this setup::
        
          url(r'^page(?P<url>/.*)$', 'microcms.views.pages'),
        
        then the full URL of that page will be::
        
          /page/about/
          
        The title attribute of the page will be available unescaped in the
        template as variable ``title``.
        
        For each page, you can add content. Only pages that have content parts
        defined are shown. If a page has no content in the fallback language,
        it will only be shown when the requested language version exists.
        
        The ``content`` attribute of each language version is given to the
        template unescaped.
        
          
        
        On the page
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Each page is available under its URL (once there is at least one
        content part defined). Additionally, it is also available under its
        URL with a language code prepended.
        
        An example.
        
        Let's say you have wired up the ``pages`` view as above, to be seen on
        the page as ``^page(?P<url>/.*)$'``. Then each page you create will be
        available at the URL you defined. For example, if you have pages with
        URLS ``/about/``, ``/imprint/`` and ``/about/contact/``, the will be
        available as::
        
          /page/about/
          /page/imprint/
          /page/about/contact/
        
        If a user requests the page in a locale that has defined content, then
        the correct content will be served up. If you have content for locales
        ``en`` and ``de`` for example, and a user requests the page in German,
        the ``de`` variant of the content will be served. If you have variants
        in ``es`` and ``es-mx``, and a user requests content in ``es-ar``, the
        ``es`` variant will be served.
        
        To allow serving specific languages, you can prepend the language code
        to the page part of your URL. The above-outlined variants will be
        available under the following URLs::
        
          /page/en/about/
          /page/de/about/
          /page/es/about/
          /page/es-mx/about/
