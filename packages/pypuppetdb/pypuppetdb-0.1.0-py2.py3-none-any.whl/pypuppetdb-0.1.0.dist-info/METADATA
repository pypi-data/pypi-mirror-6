        pypuppetdtb is a library to work with PuppetDB's REST API. It is implemented
        using the `requests`_ library.
        
        .. _requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
        
        This library is a thin wrapper around the REST API providing some convinience
        functions and objects to request and hold data from PuppetDB.
        
        To use this library you will need:
            * Python 2.6 or 2.7
            * Python 3.3
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install this package from source or from PyPi.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ pip install pypuppetdb
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ git clone https://github.com/nedap/pypuppetdb
           $ python setup.py install
        
        If you wish to hack on it clone the repository but after that run:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        This will install all the runtime requirements of pypuppetdb and the
        dependencies for the test suite and generation of documentation.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Once you have pypuppetdb installed you can configure it to connect to PuppetDB
        and take it from there.
        
        Connecting
        ----------
        
        The first thing you need to do is to connect with PuppetDB:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           >>> from pypuppetdb import connect
           >>> db = connect()
        
        Nodes
        -----
        
        The following will return a generator object yielding Node objects for every
        returned node from PuppetDB.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           >>> nodes = db.nodes()
           >>> for node in nodes:
           >>>   print(node)
           host1
           host2
           ...
        
        To query a single node the singular `node()` can be used:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> node = db.node('hostname')
            >>> print(node)
            hostname
        
        Node scope
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The Node objects are a bit more special in that they can query for facts and
        resources themselves. Using those methods from a node object will automatically
        add a query to the request scoping the request to the node.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           >>> node = db.node('hostname')
           >>> print(node.fact('osfamily'))
           osfamily/hostname
        
        Facts
        -----
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           >>> facts = db.facts('osfamily')
           >>> for fact in facts:
           >>>   print(fact)
           osfamily/host1
           osfamily/host2
        
        That queries PuppetDB for the 'osfamily' fact and will yield Fact objects,
        one per node this fact is known for.
        
        Resources
        ---------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           >>> resources = db.resources('file')
        
        Will return a generator object containing all file resources you're managing
        across your infrastructure. This is probably a bad idea if you have a big
        number of nodes as the response will be huge.
        
        Catalogs
        ---------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           >>> catalog = db.catalog('hostname')
           >>> for res in catalog.get_resources():
           >>>     print(res)
        
        Will return a Catalog object with the latest Catalog of the definded host. This
        catalog contains the defined Resources and Edges.
        
        Getting Help
        ============
        This project is still very new so it's not inconceivable you'll run into
        issues.
        
        For bug reports you can file an `issue`_. If you need help with something
        feel free to hit up `@daenney`_ by e-mail or find him on IRC. He can usually
        be found on `IRCnet`_ and `Freenode`_ and idles in #puppet.
        
        There's now also the #puppetboard channel on `Freenode`_ where we hang out
        and answer questions related to pypuppetdb and Puppetboard.
        
        .. _issue: https://github.com/nedap/pypuppetdb/issues
        .. _@daenney: https://github.com/daenney
        .. _IRCnet: http://www.ircnet.org
        .. _Freenode: http://freenode.net
        
        Documentation
        =============
        API documentation is automatically generated from the docstrings using
        Sphinx's autodoc feature. 
        
        Documentation will automatically be rebuilt on every push thanks to the
        Read The Docs webhook. You can `find it here`_.
        
        .. _find it here: https://pypuppetdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
        
        You can build the documentation manually by doing:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ cd docs
           $ make html
        
        Doing so will only work if you have Sphinx installed, which you can acheive
        through:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Contributing
        ============
        
        We welcome contributions to this library. However, there are a few ground
        rules contributors should be aware of.
        
        License
        -------
        This project is licensed under the Apache v2.0 License. As such, your
        contributions, once accepted, are automatically covered by this license.
        
        Commit messages
        ---------------
        Write decent commit messages. Don't use swear words and refrain from
        uninformative commit messages as 'fixed typo'.
        
        The preferred format of a commit message:
        
        ::
        
            docs/quickstart: Fixed a typo in the Nodes section.
        
            If needed, elaborate further on this commit. Feel free to write a
            complete blog post here if that helps us understand what this is
            all about.
        
            Fixes #4 and resolves #2.
        
        If you'd like a more elaborate guide on how to write and format your commit
        messages have a look at this post by `Tim Pope`_.
        
        .. _Tim Pope: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html
        
        Tests
        -----
        Commits are expected to contain tests or updates to tests if they add to or
        modify the current behaviour.
        
        The test suite is powered by `pytest`_ and requires `pytest`_, `pytest-pep8`_,
        `httpretty`_ and `pytest-httpretty`_ which will be installed for you if you
        run:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        .. _pytest: http://pytest.org/latest/
        .. _pytest-pep8: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-pep8
        .. _httpretty: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/httpretty/
        .. _pytest-httpretty: https://github.com/papaeye/pytest-httpretty
        
        To run the unit tests (the ones that don't require a live PuppetDB):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
           
           $ py.test -v -m unit
        
        If the tests pass, you're golden. If not we'll have to figure out why and
        fix that. Feel free to ask for help on this.
        
        #########
        Changelog
        #########
        
        0.1.0
        =====
        Significant changes have been made in this release. The complete v3 API is
        now supported except for query pagination.
        
        Most changes are backwards compatible except for a change in the SSL
        configuration. The previous behaviour was buggy and slightly misleading in
        the names the options took:
        
        * ``ssl`` has been renamed to ``ssl_verify`` and now defaults to ``True``.
        * Automatically use HTTPS if ``ssl_key`` and ``ssl_cert`` are provided.
        
        For additional instructions about getting SSL to work see the Quickstart
        in the documentation.
        
        Deprecation
        ------------
        Support for API v2 will be dropped in the 0.2.x release series.
        
        New features
        ------------
        
        The following features are **only** supported for **API v3**.
        
        The ``node()`` and ``nodes()`` function have gained the following options:
        
          * ``with_status=False``
          * ``unreported=2``
        
        When ``with_status`` is set to ``True`` an additional query will be made using
        the ``events-count`` endpoint scoped to the latest report. This will result in
        an additional ``events`` and ``status`` keys on the node object. ``status``
        will be either of ``changed``, ``unchanged`` or ``failed`` depending on if
        ``events`` contains ``successes`` or ``failures`` or none.
        
        By default ``unreported`` is set to ``2``. This is only in effect when
        ``with_status`` is set to ``True``. It means that if a node hasn't checked in
        for two hours it will get a ``status`` of ``unreported`` instead.
        
        New endpoints:
        
          * ``events-count``: ``events_count()``
          * ``aggregate-event-counts``: ``aggregate_event_counts()``
          * ``server-time``: ``server_time()``
          * ``version``: ``current_version()``
          * ``catalog``: ``catalog()``
        
        New types:
        
          * ``pypuppetdb.types.Catalog``
          * ``pypuppetdb.types.Edge``
        
        Changes to types:
        
          * ``pypuppetdb.types.Node`` now has:
            * ``status`` defaulting to ``None``
            * ``events`` defaulting to ``None``
            * ``unreported_time`` defaulting to ``None``
        
        0.0.4
        =====
        
        Due to a fairly serious bug 0.0.3 was pulled from PyPi minutes after release.
        
        When a bug was fixed to be able to query for all facts we accidentally
        introduced a different bug that caused the ``facts()`` call on a node to
        query for all facts because we were resetting the query.
        
        * Fix a bug where ``node.facts()`` was causing us to query all facts because
          the query to scope our request was being reset.
        
        0.0.3
        =====
        
        With the introduction of PuppetDB 1.5 a new API version, v3, was also
        introduced. In that same release the old ``/experimental`` endpoints
        were removed, meaning that as of PuppetDB 1.5 with the v2 API you can
        no longer get access to reports or events.
        
        In light of this the support for the experimental endpoints has been
        completely removed from pypuppetdb. As of this release you can only get
        to reports and/or events through v3 of the API.
        
        This release includes preliminary support for the v3 API. Everything that
        could be done with v2 plus the experimental endpoints is now possible on
        v3. However, more advanced funtionality has not yet been implemented. That
        will be the focus of the next release.
        
        * Removed dependency on pytz.
        * Fixed the behaviour of ``facts()`` and ``resources()``. We can now
          correctly query for all facts or resources.
        * Fixed an issue with catalog timestampless nodes.
        * Pass along the ``timeout`` option to ``connect()``.
        * Added preliminary PuppetDB API v3 support.
        * Removed support for the experimental endpoints.
        * The ``connect()`` method defaults to API v3 now.
        
        0.0.2
        =====
        * Fix a bug in ``setup.py`` preventing successful installation.
        
        0.0.1
        =====
        Initial release. Implements most of the v2 API.
