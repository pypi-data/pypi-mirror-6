MDTools
----------

A [NEON](http://www.neoninc.org) created module for creating and writing generic xml metadata.  This module allows users to read in a flat file structure and create an XML metadata tree.  Alternatively nodes can be added with different classes allowing the module to be used as a backbone for Metadata specific standard modules.  A full manual can be found at http://neondps.github.io/MDTools
