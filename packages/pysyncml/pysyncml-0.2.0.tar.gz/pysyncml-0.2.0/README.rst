=======================
Python SyncML Framework
=======================

Welcome to the ``pysyncml`` library, a pure-python implementation of
the SyncML adapter framework and protocol. SyncML_ is a protocol to
synchronize opaque objects between multiple clients and a
server. Although pysyncml does provide some utilities to synchronize
certain types of content and is therefore useful as-is, it is
primarily intended to be used as a library by other applications that
want to add data synchronization support via SyncML.

.. important::

  2013/12/15: pysyncml is currently beta. That means it has not had
  much "real-world" experience and you may encounter many
  bugs. However, it is being actively developed, so check back in a
  couple of months.

  If you decide to use it anyway, you are strongly encouraged to do a
  full backup of your data *before* you use pysyncml to synchronize
  production data.

  Working components as of 0.2.0:

  * Client-side SyncML framework with support for CRUD operations,
    i.e. Add/Replace/Delete Sync commands.

  * Server-side SyncML framework with support for CRUD operations,
    i.e. Add/Replace/Delete Sync commands, **BUT** it is not
    recommended to use server-side yet, as some API changes are
    expected.

  * Server-side conflict detection and multi-policy resolution.

  * Native support for "note" datatype.


Goals
=====

The pysyncml project has the following goals, some of them diverge
critically from other SyncML implementations and are the reasons for
creating a new package instead of building on other existing
implementations:

* Can be installed and used with a single "``pip install pysyncml``"
  (or easy_install).
* Is python 2.7+ and 3+ compatible.
* Implements a sufficiently large subset of the SyncML 1.2.2 (a.k.a.
  the OMA Data Synchronization specification) as to be interoperable
  with other implementations without necessarily being "conformant".
* Can be easily integrated into SQLAlchemy_ based projects to
  store data in the application's database instead of separated out
  (so that integrated database triggers and cascading can be applied).
* Can be extended in order to make properly crafted clients able
  to operate in "distributed" mode - this means that in the absence
  of a network, SyncML client peers are able to synchronize with
  each other in the anticipation that the central server may or may
  not eventually become available again.
* Differentiates as little as possible between "client" and "server"
  modes to enable the previous goal.
* Makes basic synchronization easy and complicated synchronization
  possible by providing standard implementations for commonly used
  approaches, while allowing these components to be overriden or
  extended.
* Provides basic command line tools for commonly synchronized data
  types.
* Provides a framework of server-push notifications which are
  transport agnostic.
* Auto-discovery of SyncML server URI locations; i.e. finding the
  "right" paths to bind object types is done automatically instead
  of needing error-prone user configuration.


Limitations
===========

It is the goal of the project to get a minimally functional library going
in the shortest possible timeframe. To that end, the following features
of SyncML will *NOT* be implemented until a later phase, even if this means
that the library does not provide a conformant implementation:

* NOT supported: filtering of searches or synchronization targets.
* NOT supported: data split over multiple messages.
* NOT supported: soft-deletes.
* NOT supported: memory constraint management.
* NOT supported: suspend, resume and busy signaling.
* NOT supported: MD5 authentication scheme.
* NOT supported: per-database-layer authorization.


Installation
============

Installation of pysyncml is near-trivial with PIP_:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install pysyncml

or, using easy_install_:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ easy_install pysyncml


Pre-Requisites
==============

Python 2.7 or better is required, as the following is "taken for
granted" by the pysyncml developers:

* relative imports,
* "with" context manager statement,
* native ElementTree,
* ternary expression (EXPR if EXPR else EXPR),
* and something else which was found to not work in 2.6.4 but the
  author cannot remember what it was and does not wish to run into
  that limitation ever again...
