Description: ======================
        silva.app.redirectlink
        ======================
        
        ``silva.app.redirectlink`` is an extension for Silva 2.2 that lets you
        use a new a content type, a redirect link, which does a permanent HTTP
        redirect to its target.
        
        You shouldn't add these redirect links to your site manually. They
        are automatically created when you move or rename content in Silva.
        
        This lets you preserve old URLs to access moved or renamed contents,
        telling the visitor to permanently update its reference to it. This
        means search engines will update their search caches with the new
        URL of your moved or renamed content. This prevents having content
        disappear from search results when it was easily found before.
        
        When you think that visitors and search engines have updated their
        references to the moved or renamed contents, you can delete those links
        in order to definitively disable all old URLs.
        
        You can keep moving and renaming content items as many times you wish.
        The redirect link will keep tracking the content each time it moves
        using intids.
