Description: ==============
        Django KVModel
        ==============
        
        ``KVModel`` provides a very convenient way to create key-value models with
        just two lines of code. ::
        
            from kvmodel.models import KVModel
            
            class SystemSettings(KVModel):
                """    
                SystemSettings Model now extends KVModel, and you will
                be able to access the key and the value fields on that Model
                """
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can Install ``django-kvmodel`` from PyPI.
            ``pip install django-kvmodel``
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Add ``kvmodel`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting:::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'kvmodel',
                ...
            )
        
        This will enable kvmodel, form more advanced settings please check the advanced
        section.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ``KVModel`` is an abstract model that has two fields ``key`` and ``value``.
        
        - ``key`` is a unique `CharField`. 
        - ``value`` is a `SerializableField` which means that it's type is restored when
          loading an instance from the database, check out the advanced section for more
          details about ``SerializableField``.
        
        Defining key-value models
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Extend ``KVModel`` to create a key-value model::
        
            from kvmodel.models import KVModel
        
            class Settings(KVModel):
                pass
        
        Creating instances
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        You can create Instances the same way you will use a Django Model
            ``setting = Settings(key='dragons_in_store', value=123)``
        
        for a persistent instance
            ``setting = Settings.create(key='dragons_in_store', value=123)``
        
        Retrieving instances
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        you can use Django filters to retrieve data from your model, however you
        shouldn't use the value field to search for data.
        
        there is also a method to retrieve objects using their key:
            ``setting = Settings.get_by_key('dragons_in_store')``
        
        which is equivalent to:
            ``setting = Settings.get(key='dragons_in_store')``
        
        Advanced Usage
        --------------
        
        SerializableField
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        this is a custom field that extends ``TextField``, it encodes the data before
        saving and decodes it once an instance is loaded from the database.
        
        you can use ``SerilizableField`` like this::
            
            from kvmodes.models import KVModel
            from kvmodel.fields import SerilizableField
        
            class SystemSettings(KVModel):
                default = SerialiableField()
        
        By default ``SerializableField`` uses JSON for de-serializing data however you
        can define your custom de-serializers.     
        
        the `serialize` function is called before the object is saved to the database,
        it should accept the value and returns a string.
        
        the `deserialize` function is called when loading an instance from the data base,
        it should accept a string and return the restored value 
        
        Defining Custom serializer/derserilizer
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        define the functions you want to use as de-serilizers::
        
            aes_serialize(value):
                return aes_encrypt(json.dumps(value), key='super secret key')
        
            aes_deserialize(s):
                return json.loads(aes_decrypt(s, key='super secret key'))
        
        next you should update the ``KVMODEL`` setting::
        
            KVMODEL = {
                'SERIALIZE_FUNCTION': 'appname.modulename.aes_serilize',
                'DESERIALIZE_FUNCTION': 'appname.modulename.aes_deserialize'
            }
