`txscrypt`_ is a `Twisted`_-friendly wrapper for `scrypt`_. `scrypt`_
is a key derivation function. It's the kind of thing you want to use
to store user's passwords securely, if you're writing a password
storage library. (If you're not, use one.)

How do I store a password?
==========================

Easy.

.. code:: python

    from txscrypt import computeKey
    d = computeKey(password)
    d.addCallback(storeSomewhere)

``computeKey`` is a function. You give it the plaintext password, in
bytes. If your user is giving you a password in Unicode, encode it
first. You get a deferred that will fire, at some point, with a
magical string of bytes. Store it.

Okay. How do I check a password?
================================

.. code:: python

    from txscrypt import checkPassword
    d = checkPassword(stored, provided)

In this snippet, ``stored`` is the thing you got from ``computeKey``.
``provided`` is the password as provided by the user. Give it the same
treatment you gave the password before you passed it to
``computeKey``. For example, if it's Unicode, encode it.

You get a deferred. At some point in the future, it will fire with
either ``True`` if the password matched or ``False`` if it didn't.

Why is the magical string base64-encoded?
=========================================

You're not supposed to care about what's in it. But, if you must know:
because if it weren't, it'd have a bunch of NUL bytes and other gnarly
non-printable ASCII stuff in it, and that makes a lot of storage stuff
balk.

Earlier versions of txscrypt used the raw bytes produced by scrypt.
Some third party tools bit off those strings after the first NUL byte.
Unluckily, this was immediately after the word "scrypt", which were
the first bytes of that string.

But what about salts?
=====================

txscrypt takes care of this for you.

(It computes a salt of sufficient length using your OS'
cryptographically secure random number generator.)

But what about timing attacks?
==============================

txscrypt takes care of this for you.

(It relies on scrypt to get this right. There might be side channels
related to multiple executions of ``scrypt`` on the same machine.)

But what about starving the thread pool?
========================================

txscrypt takes care of this for you.

(It creates a new thread pool just for running scrypt in. This means
that scrypt doesn't compete against, say, DNS resolution, or things
you pass to ``deferToThread``.)

But what about shutting down the thread pool?
=============================================

txscrypt takes care of this for you.

(It tells the reactor to stop the thread pool at the start of its own
shutdown procedure.)

When should I create my own Wrapper object?
===========================================

If you want to change:

- the maximum computation time
- the salt length
- the thread pool

So, basically, never.

Changelog
=========

2.0.0
-----

**Incompatible change with previous versions!**

- Now uses the newly exposed ``hash`` function, making key derivation
  fully deterministic.
- The ``maxTime`` argument has been removed.

1.1.1
-----

- Remove stale references to verifyPassword in documentation and
  __all__

Thanks Matt Haggard for the bug report!

1.1.0
-----

- Only start the thread pool on first use
- Stop the thread pool when the reactor starts shutting down

1.0.0
-----

**Incompatible change with previous versions!**

- Remove deprecated verifyPassword API
- Use less high-quality entropy for salt bits
- Use term "salt", consistency with scrypt paper
- Base64s output, prevents other software choking on NUL bytes
- Internal rewrite, easier to test
