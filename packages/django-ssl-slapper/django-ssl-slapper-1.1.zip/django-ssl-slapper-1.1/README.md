Django SSL Slapper
===================

Django-SSL-Slapper is a middleware that allows you to set urls to ssl only.  It can also redirects anonymous users off your https service onto your http.  Logged-in users may also be directed to https.

Django-SSL-Slapper can also use cache to count the number of login attempts and slap away excessive entries (default more than 20 per minute).  THe user account is temporary locked for a timer period (default 1 minute).  The default settings should disrupt automated attempts for entry without bothering even the quickest users.
