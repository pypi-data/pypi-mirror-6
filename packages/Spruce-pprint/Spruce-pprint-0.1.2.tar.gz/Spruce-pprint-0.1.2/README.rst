Spruce-pprint is a Python library for string formatting.  It is an
extension of Python's pprint_ module.

These tools beautify text strings, especially string representations of
Python objects.  They are not responsible for constructing the original
strings or string representations---that is the prerogative of methods
such as **__repr__()** and **__str__()** and of application-specific
formatting functions.
