0.2 (2014-04-24)
================

- Python 3 support, in particular Python 3.4 (Alec Munro - fudomunro
  on github).

- Link generation now takes ``SCRIPT_NAME`` into account.

- Morepath 0.1 had a security system, but it was undocumented. Now it's
  documented (docs now in :doc:`security`), and some of its behavior was slightly tweaked:

  * new ``verify_identity`` directive.

  * ``permission`` directive was renamed to ``permission_rule``.

  * default unauthorized error is 403 Forbidden, not 401 Unauthorized.

  * ``morepath.remember`` and ``morepath.forbet`` renamed to
    ``morepath.remember_identity`` and ``morepath.forget_identity``.

- Installation documentation tweaks. (Auke Willem Oosterhoff)

- ``.gitignore`` tweaks (Auke Willem Oosterhoff)
