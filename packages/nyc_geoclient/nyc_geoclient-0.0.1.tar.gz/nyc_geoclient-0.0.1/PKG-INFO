Description: # NYC Geoclient Python Bindings
        
        Bindings for the REST [NYC Geoclient API][api] in Python.
        
          [api]: http://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api-beta
        
        ### How to use
        
        First, you will need to register an application with the [NYC Developer
        Portal][portal], and make sure that you check off access to the Geoclient API
        for the application.  Take note of the Application's ID and key.  You will not
        be able to use the ID and key until DoITT approves you -- this could take
        several days, and you will receive an email when this happens.  There isn't any
        indication of your status on the dashboard, but all requests will return a 403.
