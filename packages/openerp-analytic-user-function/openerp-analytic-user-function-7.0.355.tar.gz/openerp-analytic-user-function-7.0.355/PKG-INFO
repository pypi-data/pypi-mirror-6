Description: 
        
        This module allows you to define what is the default function of a specific user on a given account.
        ====================================================================================================
        
        This is mostly used when a user encodes his timesheet: the values are retrieved
        and the fields are auto-filled. But the possibility to change these values is
        still available.
        
        Obviously if no data has been recorded for the current account, the default
        value is given as usual by the employee data so that this module is perfectly
        compatible with older configurations.
