        A lightweight, robust basket app for your Django project.
        
        Based on `django-ccbasket <https://github.com/designcc/django-ccbasket>`__ but has been updated to work with Django 1.6.
        
        The `basky documentation is online <https://django-basky.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`__, but you may find parts
        that refer to ccbasket (basky's previous incarnation), like basky it is a work in progress.
