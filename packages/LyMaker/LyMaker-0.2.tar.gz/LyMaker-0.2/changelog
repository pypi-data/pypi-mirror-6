Version 0.1
initial version

Version 0.2
- do not set riff for the last bar of a part if the part has an odd number of bars.
- different tempo can now be inserted for each part
- generate no rests in chord list because Lilypond 2.18 will write N.C into the score (2.12 didn't do this).
- new drum mode (5) for generating a drum pattern.
- mode 99 mutes the bass.
- generate drum roll pattern
- bug in random drumline creation corrected (bassdrum at places it shouldn't be)
- better synchronisation between bass and bassdrum.
- corrections and additions in documentation.
