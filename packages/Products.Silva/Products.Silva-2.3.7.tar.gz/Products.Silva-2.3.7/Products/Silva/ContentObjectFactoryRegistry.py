            to, the id as used in PUT requests that trigger the creation,
            the content type (MIME-type) as specified by the client and
            the body of the request that should later be used as content
            (the factory itself doesn't have to actually write the content
            to the object, a call to PUT later on will make that happen,
            but may decide certain things from the body)

            that case checking will continue 

            checkhandler will be called with 3 arguments: the id, the
            content type as specified by the client and the body of the 
            request, and should return True or False according to whether
            the factory should be used to generate the object for this

            registered at the end of the registry period, meaning that it
            will be used as the last item (default), this is *only* useful
            for a *single* checker/factory combination, therefore if anyone 
            else has already registered a default checker this will fail
