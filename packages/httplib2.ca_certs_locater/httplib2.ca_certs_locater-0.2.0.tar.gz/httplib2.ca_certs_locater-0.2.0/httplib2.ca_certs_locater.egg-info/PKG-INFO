        ===========================
        
        This package provides a plug-in to httplib2 to tell it to use the
        certificate authority file from the base OS instead of the one in the
        httplib2 package. The file from httplib2 is used as a fallback, if the
        expected OS-specific file is not found.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
          $ pip install httplib2.ca_certs_locater
        
        Supporting Additional Platforms
        ===============================
        
        If you are on a platform with a different certificate authority file,
        please submit a pull request via github_ to add the file to ``get()``.
