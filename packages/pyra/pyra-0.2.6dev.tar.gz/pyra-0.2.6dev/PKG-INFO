Description: pyra - Python Region Algebra
        ============================
        
        
        Pyra is a python implementation of the region algebra and query language described in [1]. 
        Region algebras are used to efficiently query semi-structured text documents. This particular
        region algebra operates on Generalized Concordance Lists (GCLs). GCLs are lists of regions
        (a.k.a., extents), which obey the following constraint: *No region in the list may have another
        region from the same lists nested within it*. For a quick online introduction to this region
        algebra, and why it is useful, visit:
        
        [Wumpus Search](http://www.wumpus-search.org/docs/gcl.html) 
        
        In general, this region algebra is good for extracting data from documents that have lightweight
        structure, and is an alternative to more heavyweight solutions like XPath queries.
        
        
        ### Algebra and Query Language
        
        Our region algebra consists of the following elements:
        
        (Essentially identical to the conventions used in Wumpus [See above])
        
            Elementary Types
            —---------------
            "token"             Tokens are quoted strings. Use \" to escape quotes, and \\ to escape escapes
            "a", "b", "c"       Phrases are comma separated tokens
            INT                 Positions are indicated as bare integers (e.g., 4071)
        
            Operators (here A and B are arbitrary region algebra expressions, N is an integer)
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            A ^ B               Returns all extents that match both A and B
            A + B               Returns all extents that match either A or B (or both)
            A .. B              Returns all extents that start with A and end with B
            A > B               Returns all extents that match A and contain an extent matching B 
            A < B               Returns all extents that match A, contained in an extent matching B
        
            _{A}                The 'start' projection. For each extent (u,v) in A, return (u,u)
            {A}_                The 'end' projection. For each extent (u,v) in A, return (v,v)
        
            [N]                 Returns all extents of length N, where N is an integer (basically a sliding window)
        
            Not yet implemented:
            A /> B              Returns all extents that match A but do not contain an extent matching B
            A /< B              Returns all extents that match A, not contained in an extent matching B
        
        
        ### Examples
        
        Suppose we an XML document containing the complete works of Shakespeare (see './pyra/examples').
        We can then run the following queries using pyra:
        
        **Return the titles of all plays, acts, scenes, etc.**
        
            "<title>".."</title>"         
        
            Results:
            slice(15,23):               <title> the tragedy of antony and cleopatra </title>
            slice(68,72):               <title> dramatis personae </title>

        **Return the titles of all plays**

        ### Code Examples
        
        So how do you actually write code that uses or calls *pyra*?
        
        Here's an example implementation of the above queries:
        
                from pyra import InvertedIndex, GCL
        
                # See examples/gcl_shell.py for an example describing how to get
                # a tokenized corpus for Shakespeare
        
                iindex  = InvertedIndex(tokens)
                gcl     = GCL(iidx)  
        
                # Print titles of acts, plays, scenes, etc
                for myslice in g.parse('"<title>".."</title>"'):
                    print("%s \t %s", (str(myslice), " ".join(corpus[myslice]))
        
        
                # Print titles of plays
                play_titles = g.parse('("<title>".."</title>") < ("<play>".."</title>")')
        
                for myslice in play_titles:
                    print("%s \t %s", (str(myslice), " ".join(corpus[myslice]))
        
                
                # Return the titles of plays containing the word 'henry'
                #
                # Use parameterization to reuse the last expression
                # (Makes for readable code, and may benefit from results caching
                # if I ever get around to implementing it)
        
                for myslice in g.parse('%1 > "henry"', play_titles):
                    print("%s \t %s", (str(myslice), " ".join(corpus[myslice]))
              
        
                # Return the titles of plays, where the plays mention a
                # 'witch' and 'duncan' 
        
                whole_plays = g.parse("<play>..</play>")
                for myslice in g.parse('%1 < (%2 > ("witch" ^ "duncan"))', play_titles, whole_plays):
                    print("%s \t %s", (str(myslice), " ".join(corpus[myslice]))
        
        
        ### Ply Grammar
        
        This package uses ply python module to parse the GCL expressions.
        Here is a simplified sketch of the grammar pyra uses:
        
            gcl_expr :  ( gcl_expr )            |
                        gcl_expr ... gcl_expr   |
                        gcl_expr > gcl_expr     |
                        gcl_expr < gcl_expr     |
                        [ INT ]                 |
                        INT                     |
                        phrase
        
            phrase : STRING , phrase  |
                     STRING
