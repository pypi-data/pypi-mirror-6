Description: django-tdd
        ==========
        
        A Django management command to run tests every time a file is saved.
        
        Installation
        ===
        
            pip install django-tdd
        
        Then add django-tdd to your INSTALLED_APPS:
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = {
              ...
              'django_tdd',
            }
        
        Usage
        ===
        
        Use the management command in place of `runserver`. The following command will run all of the tests in your project and then start the development server.
        
            python manage.py tdd
        
        When you change a file, the development server will stop, all the tests will be run again, and the development server will start again.
