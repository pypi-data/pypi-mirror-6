1.1.4
-----

Features added:

- SilvaFind does not add a default search instance inside
  the service_find directory anymore. This was only being
  used by the dlcms, which will add it anyway, if it's not there.

1.1.3 (2008/03/03)
------------------

Changes:

- SilvaFind is now using Silva 2.0 zcml extension
  registration.  From this version forward this
  product will not work in Silva 1.6 or lower.

- Changed product to work with Silva 2.1
  zcml extension registration.

Bugs Fixed:

- metatypecriterion used all types when no selection was
  made in SMI, it should have used all *available* types
  instead since this could be overwritten with an adapter.

1.1.2
-----

Changes:

- i18n readied for Silva 2.0+.

- Changed product to work with Silva 2.1
  zcml extension registration.

1.1.1.2
-------

Changes:

- metatypecriterion allows for list values.

- Some code refactoring in MetatypeCriterionView, so it's easier
  to override.

- Changed the line and border colors in the public view from green
  to gray and removed a green background so it's less likely that
  the SilvaFind colors will conflict with a user's site design.

- Empty searches show nothing instead of everything.

Bugs Fixed:

- Removed hardcoded Silva Document checks in favor of IVersion
  interfaces.

- KeyError for meta_type when doing empty searches.

- SilvaFind search was searching on all "search content" fields,
  and ignoring the checkboxes.

1.1.1
-----

Bugs Fixed:

- Getting path criterion value from request failed because paths
  in the catalog can't have unicode characters.
