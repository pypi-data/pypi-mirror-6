In order to support third party images formats through FreeImage you may need to install
`Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64) <http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/8/0/A80747C3-41BD-45DF-B505-E9710D2744E0/vcredist_x64.exe>`_.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open *sIBL_GUI.dmg* and drag *sIBL_GUI 4.app* into the *Application* directory.


Linux Platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| *sIBL_GUI 4* is currently not built on Linux because of several issues.
