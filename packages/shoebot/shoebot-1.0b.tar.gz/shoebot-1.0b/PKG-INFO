Description: 
         Shoebot is a pure Python graphics robot: It takes a Python script as input,
         which describes a drawing process, and outputs a graphic in a common open
         standard format (SVG, PDF, PostScript, or PNG). It has a simple text editor
         GUI, and scripts can describe their own GUIs for controlling variables
         interactively. Being pure Python, it can also be used as a Python module,
         a plugin for Python-scriptable tools such as Inkscape, and run from the
         command line.
