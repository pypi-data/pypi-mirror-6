DK utility classes
===============================

Various basic packages pulled from our source tree.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation lives at http://dk.readthedocs.org/



Running the tests
-------------------

I use py.test to run the tests, so there might be some dependencies that
unittest.py by itself can't handle.
