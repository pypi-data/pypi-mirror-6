Description: ======
        Spyral
        ======
        
        Spyral is a library/engine for developing 2D games in Python 2.X, with a focus in rapid development and clean design. Any system that runs Pygame should be able to run Spyral. Instead of ``import pygame``, you'll just use ``import spyral`` instead.
        
        Pre-requisites
        --------------
        
        * `Pygame <http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml>`_
        * `Parsley <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Parsley>`_
        * `Greenlets <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/greenlet>`_ (optional, if you want to use the powerful Actors feature for multi-processing)
        
        Using Spyral on the XO Laptop
        -----------------------------
        
        Spyral was specifically designed for developing XO laptop games. Spyral's main source of documentation can be found at the Platipy project, which documents Spyral in the context of a university course for which it was developed. `Visit the Platipy Project <http://platipy.org>`_
        
        Using Spyral Elsewhere
        ----------------------
        
        A simple `Skeleton <https://github.com/platipy/spyral/blob/master/examples/skel.py>`_ , along with many other `examples <https://github.com/platipy/spyral/tree/master/examples>`_ are available.
        
        Known Bugs
        ----------
        
        * Not compliant with 3.x (XO laptops use Python 2.5, so we don't target 3.x).
