        A Docker cluster construction utility.
        
        DryDock takes a simple (YAML_) specification file then can construct and
        configure a cluster of Docker_ containers. DryDock will automatically
        setup a reverse proxy, exposure of ports, and even persistent storage to
        allow for easy future upgrading by simply rebuilding the DryDock
        specification!
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Simple YAML_ configuration.
        * Automatic Docker_ cluster provisioning/configuration
        * Nginx_ reverse proxy configuration with HTTPS/SSL support
        * Easy setup for persistent volumes.
        * Share your DryDock specifications with the world.
        * Container supervisor utilizing the Docker_ API.
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        * Provide a better update path.
        * Add a stateless shareable mysql container to prepare and specification.
        * Better support for stateless-ness and volumes
        * Better unittest coverage eg. reports.

        History
        -------
        
        0.5.0 (15-03-2014)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        .. warning:
        This release has a major emphasis on the ``master`` command and containers
        and is released early to facilitate testing.
        
        * Changed: ``master`` command now takes a specification to automatically
        build it.
        * Removed: any usage of ``supervisord`` in favor of the new
        ``drydock supervisor``.
        
        0.4.3 (12-03-2014)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Fix: use ``--name`` for naming containers for future proofing.
        * Fix: use ``--dns`` for future proofing.
        
        0.4.2 (11-03-2014)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Fix: allow self connections to the host when nginx blocks external.
        
        0.4.1 (09-03-2014)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Fix: check for config files before removing them.
        * Fix: ``supervise`` command will now recreate the nginx container each run.
        
        0.4.0 (08-03-2014)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        
        * Added: ``supervise`` command line command. DryDock has its own supervisor!
        * Added: ``start`` and ``stop`` command line commands.
        * Added: ``data`` in subcontainer specification maps volumes at
        ``/mnt/drydock``.
        * Fix: All containers are passed their FQDN as their hostname
        * Fix: ``pull`` command also grabs the containers required for the
        ``prepare`` command.
        * Fix: Pass host timezone to subcontainers.
        * Fix: volumes now go map to ``/var/lib/{domain}/{name}/``.
        
        0.3.0 (28-02-2014)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        * Added: reports at the end of running all the major commands.
