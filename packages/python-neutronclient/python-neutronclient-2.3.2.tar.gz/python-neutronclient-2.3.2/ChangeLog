    Fix neutron port-create --no-security-groups
    
    Previously, this would pass in {'security_groups': null} to neutron-server
    which uses is_attr() in _ensure_default_security_group_on_port() which returns
    False as is_attr() now checks for None and not just ATTR_NOT_SPECIFIED.

    Handle IpAddressInUse with client exception
    
    Nova is not able to reliably distinguish between port OverQuota 409
    errors and IpAddressInUse 409 errors when setting up networks for
    instances. The client needs to provide a more granular exception so
    nova can translate the error to it's own set of exceptions.
    
    Also adds a test case for the exception_handler_v20 utility method which
    was lacking explicit test coverage before this change.

    Fix lb-healthmonitor-update to work with correct object
    
    Previously in case specified id was incorrect, client fetched
    healthmonitors trying to filter them by name which had no effect since
    healthmonitor object doesn't have name attribute.
    The patch fixes the behavior by making lb-healthmonitor-update rely
    on finding resource by id, not by name-or-id

    [fwaas] Can now create disabled firewall rules
    
    Previously, the --disabled flag was ignored when creating
    firewall rules. This patch fixes that problem, closes the bug
    and adds a test. I changed update_dict so that values are sent
    on to the API call if they are not None (So False values are
    sent as well).
    
    Before this patch, when creating a resource, values were
    inserted into the API call only if their value was not None
    or False. This worked fine for values whose default value
    was False. 'enabled', however, has a default value of True.
    That means that sending enable=False wouldn't work.
    
    After the change to update_dict the issue, however, was that
    'shared' and 'audited' were then always sent (Even if their
    default was False) but the unit tests weren't expecting a False
    value since it wasn't explicitly stated. Instead of changing
    the unit tests, the solution is to only send the value in the
    first place if it is not the default value, using argparse's
    default mechanism. If it is the default, then it is written as
    None and so is not sent, and not checked by the unit tests either.

    Forcibly clear connection pool after every request
    
    Neutron client is ending up with bad socket descriptors
    which causes the behavior including trying to read from
    the socket that amqp currently holds etc. A temporary
    solution is to clear the connection pool so we get a
    fresh socket built for every request.

    Allow 'any' option for protocol in the firewall rule
    
    Closes-Bug: #1217212
    
    The current allowed values for
    protocol are tcp, udp and icmp. Adding
    'any' as allowed option. Since the
    API expects 'None' value for 'any',
    the 'create' and 'update' changes the
    args to 'None' when 'any' is set.

    The "arg_value" was not getting checked for empty list
    
    In the _merge_args function it is possible that "arg_value" which is
    an instance of a list can be an empty list. We still want to append
    "value" which is also an instance of list (passed as part of "_extra_values"
    argument) to it. arg_value was not getting checked for empty list.

    Move vpn unittest code to neutronclient.tests
    
    Closes-Bug: #1217205
    
    This commit fixes the following bugs which are detected by moving
    VPN unittests.
    
    * Raise CommandError instead of Value/KeyError in VPN parameter
      validation (Closes-Bug: #1219192)
    
    * Delete dpd_timeout_less_than_interval test in IPsec site
      connection tests.  CLI does not validate this and it raises
      ConnectionError and results in the test failure.
      (Previously this test catches a general Exception,
       so the unit test does not fail unexpectedly.)
      (Closes-Bug: #1219389)
    
      There is a confusion on whether dpd_timeout == dpd_interval
      should be accepted in server side code, document and CLI.
      it is important to make VPN related tests enabled, so I decided
      to leave the fix of validation logic in the future work.

    Makes client always use provided endpoint_url
    
    When nova uses neutron-client and the client needs to authenticate with
    keystone it will additionally retrieve the service-catalog. The client will
    then ignore the provided endpoint_url parameter given to it during
    instantiation because the service-catalog retrieval process overrides that
    parameter.
    
    Using the endpoint declared in the service-catalog even though the endpoint is
    given is unexpected given the precedent set by glance-client to respect that
    parameter. Ensuring the parameter is used will allow users to override the
    identity's catalog. This is useful if identity is in error, or if the user is
    using a special development configuration.
    
    Unit tests are included to test that said functionality occurs.

    Don't log the credentials by default
    
    Even in case of DEBUG level logging credentials (especially those that
    give admin level access) should not be saved into log files.
    
    This way of handling it has the side effect that if someone uses
    password "password", it will be replaced in another place too... but
    password "password" or some other keyword that can be found in the
    request itself was a pretty bad idea to begin with.
    
    Shell utilities are not affected and the verbose mode will still
    display the passwords to make debugging easy.

    raise better exception for duplicate match
    
    When a duplicate match is found the client previously raised a
    NeutronClientException which made it hard for programs using the client
    to handle errors. This patch now  makes it raise a

    Don't convert httplib2 exceptions to status codes
    
    Currently HTTPClient class sets the 'force_exception_to_status_code'
    instance variable to True. This actually leads to the next problem:
    there is no way to distinguish between errors which have the same
    status code. E. g. both SSL handshake error and a general Bad Request
    error have status code 400, and the only way to distinguish between them
    is to analyze the error message content, that is both error-prone and ugly.
    
    The proposed solution:
      - leaves the 'force_exception_to_status_code' set to False
      - adds a try/except wrapper for the request() call to handle
        httplib2 exceptions (e. g. host not found, socket timeout, etc)

    Allow user to specify None value to attributes
    
    Bug #1086232
    
    We introduce the action=clear to unknown argument part of
    the command line. With this option, user can specify which
    attribute will have None value.
    
    For example to set dns_nameservers of subnet to None, we use:
    quantum subnet-update subnetname --dns_nameservers action=clear
    
    Of course, client command developer can use known option like --no-gateway
    to do the same job.

    Make --version option print a more detailed client version.
    
    The python quantum client was printing "quantum 2.0" regardless of
    the version of the client.  This seems to be the version of the
    API but people expect the version of the client to be printed.
    
    I looked at the implementation of --version in nova and keystone.
    The one in keystone worked and was fairly straight-forward
    utilizing code from the pbr package.  I added this code to version.py
    rather than __init__.py.

    The test_extend_list_exceed_max_uri_len test case mocks
    the request() method of HTTPClient class so that it raises
    the RequestURITooLong exception. But the real method can't
    possibly raise it (Client.do_request() does this instead).
    Mocks should emulate the behavior of methods they stub out
    and not change it in any way.

    Set default columns in ext-list
    
    Previously ext-list does not inherits ListCommand base class for listing
    and cannot specify columns to display. This commit changes ext-list to
    use ListCommand and adds a unit test for extensions.
    
    This also changes the default value of _formatters in ListCommand to {}.
    By this subclasses no longer override _formatters unless required.

    Allow the HTTPClient consumer to pass endpoint_type.
    
    Changes the default behavior of the client.  It will now choose
    publicURL by default rather than adminURL.
    
    Now allows the consumer to pass adminURL, internalURL or some other
    endpoint type when constructing a Client to override this default
    behavior.
    
    Adds --endpoint-type option to the shell client.  Defaults to the
    environment variable OS_ENDPOINT_TYPE or publicURL.  This was
    patterned after the same option in the Nova client.
    
    Adds a new exception type to handle the case where a suitable endpoint
    type is not found in the catalog.  Without this, the exception
    encountered is a KeyError that was not clearly reported to the caller
    of the quantum command line.

    Avoid error 414 when retrieving subnet cidrs for ListNetworks
    
    Bug 1172537
    
    In order to avoif 414 the list subnet requests will be split in
    multiple requests. The total URI len for each of these requests
    will be lower than 8K (the default maximum for eventlet.wsgi.server).
    The patch tries to submit a single request, and if the URI is too
    long an exception is raised before the request is sent over the
    wire; the exception handler will split the subnet id list, and
    submit the new requests.
    
    This patch does not address the case in which the server is
    configured with a maximum URI length different from 8K.

    It is easy to understand if the variable name matches its value.
    
    Also removes 'default=xxx' from options with store_true/false action
    since store_true/false sets the default value implicitly.

    Display security group name in security-group-rule-list
    
    It is useful to display security group name rather than its id
    for security_group_id and source_group_id.
    
    Also add '--no-nameconv' option to disable conversion from
    security group id to its name. When security-group-rule-list is executed
    by admin user it is likely more than one groups have same name.
    This option is useful for such cases.

    Make "quantum help" to show a list of subcommands.
    
    Fix bug 1023260
    
    All other OpenStack clients (nova, keystone, glance, ....) accepts
    just "help" which displays a list of subcommands. This commit makes
    quantum command consist with other OpenStack projects.
    
    After this change help behavior of quantum command becomes as follows:
    Show general help message:
      quantum --help
      quantum help
    Show help message of subcommand
      quantum help <subcommand>
      quantum <subcommand> --help

    We first lookup the resource id via id if it looks like an id.
    If we cannot find it via id, we will look it up via name.
    All of the update/show/delete support reference resource via name or id.
    To create port/subnet, we can refercen network via network's name.
    Also in port creation, we support reference subnet in fixed_ip via its name.
    
    quantum_test.sh is added to test the command lines after running 'python setup.py install'

    xxx-show commands now can accept either an id or a name of the resource to
    retrieve, similarly to the "nova get" command. This has been preferred to
    using mutually exclusive keyword argument, in order to avoid confusion
    with other CLI tools.
    
    NOTE: the current patch allow search by name only for networks.
    The restriction will be lifted once name attributes for port and subnets
    are added.

    Add retry support to the quantum client.
    
     * Based on the retry support in nova's melange_connection
       and glance
     * Retry configuration is defined during Client instantiation and
       only applied to idempotent GET requests
     * Updated all api methods to call http method helpers (delete/get/post/put)
       rather than do_request to ensure consistent behavoir for a given http
       method.
     * Fixed bug in quantum.common.exceptions.QuantumClientException that
       was unnecessarily overriding class's 'message' attribute.
     * Resolves bug 937379

    Remove generation of quantum/vcsversion.py.
    
    The quantum/vcsversion.py module is generated by the quantum project's
    setup.py, so python-quantumclient's setup.py should not also generate
    it. It is not used in python-quantumclient. Fixes bug 944363.

    Adds client side functions for quantum 'detail' actions.
    
    Fixes bug 834017. This commit:
    1. Adds library functions to exercise the 'detail' actions
       for quantum ports and networks.
    2. Modifies client function 'show_port_details()' to invoke
       'detail' action. And added 'show_port()' function to do the
       regular call without 'detail'.
    3. Adds CLIs to exercise the new client function calls. The CLIs
       options that end with '_detail' invoke equivalent 'detail' action.
       Note that with this change the previous CLI 'show_port' shall now
       show concise info about a port ie. only ID and state, while
       'show_port_detail' can be used to list the detailed information about
       a port viz. ID, state and its attachment.
    4. Modifies OutputTemplate class to add support for templates with 3 or more
       level attributes (eg. "Port interface: %(port.attachment.id)s) and
       templates containing list of multilevel-attributes (eg. "Ports:
       %(network.ports|ID: %(id)s\t\tinterface: %(attachment.id)s)s")
    5. Added respective unit tests and verified them.

    move batch_config.py to client library.
    
    do not yet add it to console_scripts, as it is more of an internal
    development tool.  If we want to expose it to users, we would
    probably incorporate it into the main quantum client, rather than
    having a separate utility.

    Second round of packaging changes
    
    This change condenses the directory structure to something more similar to
    what we had before while producing similar packages.
    
    It also introduces version.py which allows us to get the version from git tags
    (or a fallback version if not available).
