Description: Anemone
        =======
        
        Anemone is an analysis monitor written in Python. The typical use cases is monitoring of long 
        running programs on remote machines. Anemone lets the long running program (scientific analysis or 
        any other type of long running program) create reports which can be continously updated through the
        running of the analysis. Anemone will run in a separate thread and talk to interested listeners,
        typically plotting programs on remote machines. These programs can get a list of reports and
        continously plot the evolvolution of the reported variables.
        
        Anemone includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that can connect to a running analysis and show
        a list of monitors. The monitors can be plotted and the plots will update automatically.
        
        Currently only 2D plot reports are supported, but more advanced reports are also planned.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        An example of using Anemone in an application is included in the repository. The analysis program
        will publish the monitors on a TCP port, via local IPC over a unix domain sockets or any other 
        transport supported by the currently installed version of ZeroMQ.
        
        If the example program communicates over IPC via the file ``my_com`` then you can connect to it
        with the GUI and inspect the progress of the analysis live by running::
        
            python -m anemone wxgui ipc://my_com
        
        You can connect mulitple GUI programs and connect/reconnect as often as you like. You can even
        connect before the analysis program has started. The GUI will try to connect each second until the
        analysis program responds.
        
        Security
        --------
        
        The current proof-of-concept version of Anemone communicates over ZeroMQ via Python pickles which
        is NOT secure! Do not use Anemone in an open network without replacing the pickles with some other
        serialization format!
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Anemone is a Python package. It has been tested with Python 2.7 on Ubuntu Linux and requires the 
        ZeroMQ Python bindings, wxPython and matplotlib to be available. No installation is required besides
        making sure the ``anemone`` package is on the PYTHONPATH.
        
        Version and stability
        ---------------------
        
        The current version of Anemone is 0.01 and should be treated as a proof of concept and not as
        production quality software.
