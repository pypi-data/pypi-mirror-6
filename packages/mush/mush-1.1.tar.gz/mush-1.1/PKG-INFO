Description: Mush is a light weight dependency injection framework aimed at
        enabling the easy testing and re-use of chunks of code that make up
        scripts. 
        
        This is done by combining several callables into a re-usable
        runner. Those callables may produce or require resource objects which
        mush passes between them based on the type of the object. The
        callables are called roughly in the order they are added to the
        runner, but adjusted for the resources required or procuced by it.
