        kotti_disqus
        ============
        
        This is an extension to the Kotti CMS that adds a commenting system to your
        site. It uses `Disqus <http://disqus.com/>`_, so you need to register an
        account there before you can use it.

        Setup
        =====
        
        To activate the ``kotti_disqus`` add-on in your Kotti site, you need to add an
        entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste Deploy config. If
        you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option, add one. ``kotti_disqus``
        depends on ``kotti_settings`` so you need to add a line for this add-on too::
        
            kotti.configurators =
                kotti_settings.kotti_configure
                kotti_disqus.kotti_configure
        
        You can change some settings at the settings page
        (http://your.domain/@@settings or use the submenu of "Site Setup").
        
        +------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
        | Option                 | Explanation                                        |
        +========================+====================================================+
        | Disqus Shortname       | The shortname you registered at Disqus.            |
        |                        | **Necessary for the commenting system to work!**   |
        +------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
        | Disqus Base URL        | Change the base URL - useful if you move your site |
        |                        | to another URL but want to keep your comments.     |
        |                        | Will use the current URL if not set.               |
        +------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
        | Disqus Available Types | Select the types on which you want to enable       |
        |                        | comments. You can select from all types available  |
        |                        | to Kotti via ``kotti.available_types``. **If       |
        |                        | nothing is selected, comments won't appear so be   |
        |                        | sure to select at least one of these.**            |
        +------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
        
        If you need to include a type not available in ``kotti.available_types`` or
        want to force an option that can never be disabled, you can do so via
        ``kotti_disqus.extra_types``, such as::
        
          kotti_disqus.extra_types =
              kotti.resources.Document
              kotti.resources.Image
