Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.portlet.shelf is a portlet for Plone 4 that allows to display 
        Collection's results in a carousel portlet browsing them by subcollections.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To create such a portlet you have to:
        
         * create a Collection (with subcollections) that returns results for showing
           in the portlet;
         * add shelf portlet on a page where you want to add a carousel - click 'Manage 
           portlets' in one of the columns of your site;
         * choose *collective.portlet.shelf* from 'Add portlet...' menu;
         * collective.portlet.shelf portlet is based on the standard collection portlet 
           in Plone, so the same fields are available for this type of portlet as for the 
           standard Collection portlet. Fill in the fields in the portlet edit form, 
           specifying a collection that will provide content for the portlet. 
         * you can specify the number of visible tiles per page
