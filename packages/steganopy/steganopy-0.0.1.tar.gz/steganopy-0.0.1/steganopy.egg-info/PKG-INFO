Description: Steganopy
        =========
        
        |Build Status|
        
        Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such
        a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient,
        suspects the existence of the message. The word steganography is of
        Greek origin and means "concealed writing".
        
        Steganopy is a steganographic tool written in Python. It comes with a
        handy gui and an easy to use api so that it can be integrated into your
        Python projects. Steganopy allows you to encode data into any PNG image
        with an RGB or RGBA format.
        
        Files are encoded into PNG images using the least significant bit
        modification method. As long as your original image is sufficiently
        large enough to hold the data to be encode any type of file could be
        concealed within an image (Text files, other images, etc). A password
        can optionally be supplied to encrypt data prior to encoding for a truly
        unbreakable level of protection.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ``pip install steganopy``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You have two ways to use steganopy
        
        GUI
        ---
        
        Use the gui by simply issuing the command ``steganopy`` will now be able to use
        the gui to encode data into PNG images as well as extract data from
        steganographic images
        
        In a Python program
        -------------------
        
        The api offers two functions to call from within your python programs.
        *NOTE* The cipher key is optional but if you use one to encode your data
        you will have to use the same one again to extract that data.
        
        Encode data
