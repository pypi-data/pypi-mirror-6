******************

Material required
=================

This program is designed to work with :
    * a portable computer (Raspberry Pi ideally)
    * an Arduino
    * (optionnally) an Adafruit CharLCDPlate (you might want to change the code if you consider not using it)
    * a LAN to view the graph

Software requirements
=====================

    * pygal
    * pyfirmata
    * pyserial
    * GNU/Linux or UNIX/\*BSD on your portable computer

What it is for
==============

It reads datas, processes it and displays it in a nice graph.
Datas are read from the Arduino then transmitted to the computer,
processed and eventually diplayed in a nice graph available via
a network browser.
Developped for a project for the Baccalaur√©at exam.
