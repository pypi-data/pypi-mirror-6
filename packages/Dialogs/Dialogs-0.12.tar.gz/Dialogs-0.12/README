This module reads on stdin user input in natural language, parse it, call 
resolution routines when ambiguous concepts are used, and finally generate RDF 
statements that are an interpretation of the input.

It includes as well a verbalization module that conversely turns RDF statements
into a sentence in natural language.

While not strictly required, it is strongly recommanded to use 'dialogs' with a
knowledge base that follows the 'KB API' like 'minimalKB' or 'oro-server'
(http://oro.openrobots.org).

II/ USAGE
---------
