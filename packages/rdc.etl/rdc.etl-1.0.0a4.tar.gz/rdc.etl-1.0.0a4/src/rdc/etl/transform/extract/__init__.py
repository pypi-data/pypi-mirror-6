Extracts are transformations that generate output lines from something that is not one of the input channel.
As it will yield all data for each input row, the input given is usually only one empty line.

    .. attribute:: stream_data

        Generator, iterable or iterable-typed callable that is used as the data source. Often used as a shortcut to
        make fast prototypes of ETL processes from a dictionary, before going further with real data sources.

        Each iterator value should be something Hash.copy() can take as an argument.


    Example using a dict::

        >>> from rdc.etl.transform.extract import Extract

        >>> data = ({'foo': 'bar'}, {'foo': 'baz'}, )
        >>> my_extract = Extract(extract=data)

        >>> list(my_extract({}))
        [H{'foo': 'bar'}, H{'foo': 'baz'}]


    Example using a callable::

        >>> from rdc.etl.transform.extract import Extract

        >>> @Extract
        ... def my_extract():
        ...     return (
        ...         {'bar': 'baz'},
        ...         {'bar': 'boo'},
        ...     )

        >>> list(my_extract({}))
        [H{'bar': 'baz'}, H{'bar': 'boo'}]


    Example using a generator::

        >>> from rdc.etl.transform.extract import Extract

        >>> @Extract
        ... def my_extract():
        ...     yield {'bar': 'baz'}
        ...     yield {'bar': 'boo'}

        >>> print list(my_extract({}))
        [H{'bar': 'baz'}, H{'bar': 'boo'}]

    .. note::

        Whenever you can, prefer the generator approach so you're not blocking anything while computing remaining
        elements.
