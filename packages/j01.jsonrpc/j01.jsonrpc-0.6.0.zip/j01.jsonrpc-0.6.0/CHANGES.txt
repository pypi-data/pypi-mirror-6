0.6.0 (2014-03-04)
------------------

- javascript: use JSON2 as default instead of eval for load json repsonse.
  Fallback to custom implementation if no JSON2 is available.

- javascript: update to newest history.js javascripts

- javascript: implemented low level unauthorized nextURL error response
  handling in j01.proxy.js javascript.

- implemented handleError method

- changed unauthorized error page redirect from loginForm.html to
  j01Login.html for better customization. Note, you will need at least to
  register your existing loginForm.html as an additional j01Login.html page.
  Or the new nextURL redirect to j01Login.html will point ot a missing page.
  This changes makes it possible to show an explicit comment (session expires
  for jsonrpc call).

- feature: improve history state handling. Remember initial url and support
  go back to the initial url too whcih doesn't provide a ``j`` marker argument.

- feature: implemented improved json-rpc client including custom error handling
  and removed the dependency to z3c.jsonrpcproxy. This means you need to
  define the z3c.jsonrpcproxy dependency if you use the z3c.jsonrpcproxy
  javascript client in your package.
