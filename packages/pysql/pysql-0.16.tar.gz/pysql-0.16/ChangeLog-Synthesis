Switch to git and slighly reorganise source tree. Kill useless and dead
modules (pysqlio and pysqlnet). Switch from GPLv2 to GPLv3.
Full switch to Unicode inside Pysql. Honor Oracle client encoding (NLS_LANG)
for database in/out and terminal encoding for user in/out.
Add some unit test and fix all comments handling
New function parser that allow more complex and usefull command switch.
Graphical functions (datamodel, diskusage...) get new options as well as
desc (sort column) and session (display all sessions).

V0.11 2007/12/15
Reorganize all source tree and switch from custom build to distutils.
Immediate consequences is the availability of ready to install package
for Linux (RPM et Slackware tgz for now) and Windows 
(setup.exe with menu entrey and desktop shortcut).
Pysql is now installed in standard Python site-package and a wrapper is
put on PATH (default to /usr/bin).
Change configuration file behaviour : only config in $HOME is now used
All conf and cache files are now in $HOME/.pysql/ on Unix and 
%APPDATA%/pysql/ on Windows.

and datamodel function. Now enjoy things like "table foo% or (%test% and bar%bar)" 

V0.10 2007/03/18
Table data comparison is now working.

V0.9 2007/02/04
This release uses color in comparisons to highlight what has changed. The
compare function can also compare two tables (in the same or different
schema), not just two schema.

V0.8 2007/01/21
This release adds a schema "compare" function with table column name, type
comment, and indexed comparison. Just type e.g. "compare scott/tiger@test
scotty/tigrou@test". This relerase will not show a column twice when the same
table is found in different schema.

V0.7 2007/01/06
A "disk usage" graphical function was added to display where the most space is
consumed. Just type "du" or "du scott" to get a graphical view of space used
by tables and indexes for each tablespace. Like all other graphical functions,
this one is powered by graphviz.

V0.6 2006/12/13
This release adds support for CLOB objects. It adds server output support (for
dmbs_output.put_line().

V0.5 2006/12/09
The image viewer preferred by the user is called to show the graph just
generated. The update mode (pysql -u) was added to update pysql online (see
pysql -h for proxy options). The ed function was changed so that it only puts
a new statement in the history instead of executing it. The / function was
changed to be more sqlplus compliant. Specifically, it does not execute the
last command but only the last SQL statement. The Oracle dictionary reading
strategy was changed so that it does not use both user_* and all_* views, but
uses all_* only. The Oracle hint is respected when removing comments. Alpha
telnet protocol negotiation was added for pysqlnet.

V0.4 2006/12/03
A new graphical "dependencies" function was added to output a graph with
children and parent objects. Statement hints (/*+...) are no longer removed
like as if they were comments. Minor code cleanup and bugfixes were made. The
French translation was improved, but is not yet finished.

V0.3 - 2006/11/30
This release adds a pkgtree function to produce a graphical tree of
function/procedure calls inside a package. It adds more details to the session
detail command (session "d") with current statement and current statement
explain plan. Pysql has now a "server mode" that allows you to make pysql
listen to a TCP socket to be used remotely by thin client (telnet). Readline
features are not yet available in server mode. You can use a custom separator
between columns (the default is still space). Completion now works if object
names are prefixed with the schema. There are other minor features and
bugfixes. 

V0.2 - 2006/11/26
Code cleanup and documentation updates. A transposed selection bug has been
fixed. The I/O layer has been rewritten to prepare for I/O other than screen
(file, TCP socket, etc.). More unit tests have been added.

V0.1 - 2006/11/21
This version is fully usable. New features include graphical data models with
graphviz, DDL printing of every object, code browsing, and detailed
descriptions with indexed columns and comments.
