Description: silva.resourceinclude
        =====================
        
        silva.resourceinclude collect and merge resources files (CSS, KSS, JS)
        on Zope layers, and generate links in HTML pages to those
        resources. It's used by ``silva.core.layout`` to easily include
        resources in Silva Layouts.
