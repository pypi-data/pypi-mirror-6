Description: # mezzanine-slides
        
        Add simple slide functionality to your Mezzanine based website allowing for
        beautiful banners at the tops of pages.
        
        
        ## Setup
        
         1. Run `pip install mezzanine-slides`
         2. In `settings.py` add `mezzanine_slides` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` above mezzanine apps.
         3. Run createdb or syncdb, if running syncdb run migrate if you are using South.
         4. If you haven't modified your `base.html` or `pages/page.html` templates then you can just `manage.py collecttemplates mezzanine_slides` and use the ones I provide. If you've already modified these templates see the Templates section for continued instruction.
        
        
        ## Templates
        
        Add this to your `pages/page.html` anywhere as long as it's not inside another
        block:
        
            {% block slides %}{% if page.slide_set.all %}
            <div class="row">
            <div class="span12">
                <ul class="rslides">{% for image in page.slide_set.all %}
                    <li><img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}{% thumbnail image.file 940 300 %}" alt="{{ image.description }}"/></li>
                {% endfor %}</ul>
            </div>
            </div>
            {% endif %}{% endblock %}
        
        Add this to `base.html` where you would like the slides to appear, which is
        usually between your main content and the navigation:
        
            {% block slides %}{% endblock %}
        
        Notice that I include the `row` and `span12` classes on the `pages/page.html`
        template so that if you don't have any slides then nothing is added to the page.
        
        Now you'll need to include the CSS and JS in your compress areas of your
        `base.html` template:
        
            {% compress css %}
            ...
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}css/responsiveslides.css">
            {% endcompress %}
        
            
            {% compress js %}
            ...
            <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}js/responsiveslides.min.js"></script>
            {% endcompress %}
        
        Lastly you'll need to invoke the slides JavaScript by putting
        `$('.rslides').responsiveSlides();` on in your JavaScript somewhere. In the
        `base.html` template I put this in the header around line 34 where I found some
        other JavaScript functions to just make it easy and try to conform to the
        original Mezzanine as much as possible, here is an excerpt of the area:
        
            <script>
            $(function() {
                ...
                $('.rslides').responsiveSlides();
            });
            </script>
