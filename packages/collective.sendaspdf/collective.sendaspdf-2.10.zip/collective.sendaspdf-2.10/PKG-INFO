Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``collective.sendaspdf`` is an open source product for Plone that
        allows downloading the page seen by the user as a PDF file. It also
        provides a form to send the page by e-mail (a screenshot of the current
        page in a PDF format being joined to the e-mail).
        
        It relies on either of two products to generate the PDF files:
        
        - ``xhtml2pdf``: http://www.xhtml2pdf.com/
        
        - ``wkhtmltopdf``: http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/
        
        The site manager can easily choose which solution he prefers for
        the generation.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        To install the package, you can simply add ``collective.sendaspdf``
        to the eggs list in your buildout.
        Then install it using Zope's quick installer or Plone's add-on
        products manager.
        
        To install ``xhtml2pdf``, add the following to your buildout eggs
        directory::
        
             pisa
             pyPdf
             html5lib
             reportlab
        
        ``collective.sendaspdf`` has been tested with development versions of
        ``pisa`` and ``html5lib``. With the latest releases (when writing this
        README - ``html5lib`` 0.9 and ``pisa`` 3.0.33) some pages could not be
        rendered.
        
        To install ``wkhtmltopdf``, go to the projects page and download an
        executable version for your OS. Install it so the command
        ``wkhtmltopdf`` is in the PATH.
        You can also update your buildout to automatically download 
        ``wkhtmltopdf`` and have it used by your instance using the following
        recipes::
        
          [buildout]
          parts =
              ...
              wkhtmltopdf
              wkhtmltopdf_executable
        
          [instance]
          ...
          zserver-threads = 7
          environment-vars =
              ...
              WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH ${wkhtmltopdf:location}/wkhtmltopdf
        
          [wkhtmltopdf]
          recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download
          url = http://wkhtmltopdf.googlecode.com/files/wkhtmltopdf-0.9.9-static-amd64.tar.bz2
        
          [wkhtmltopdf_executable]
          recipe = collective.recipe.cmd
          on_install = true
          on_update = true
          cmds =
               cd ${buildout:directory}/parts/wkhtmltopdf
               mv wkhtmltopdf-amd64 wkhtmltopdf
               chmod +x wkhtmltopdf
        
        As you can see in this configuration, the ``zserver-threads`` number has
        been pushed to 7. This avoids troubles with threads locks when
        multiple PDFs are rendered at the same time.
        7 threads work fine when rendering 5 PDFs of the same page at the same
        time.
        
        You might have some changes to do depending on the architecture you
        are using (this example is for the amd64 architecture)
        
        Configuring
        ===========
        
        Go to the Plone control panel. You will find a 'Send as PDF' link that
        sends you to the products configuration page.
        
        This page proposes a few settings:
        
        - the tool used to render the PDF files.
        
        - the directory where the PDF files are stored.
        
        - the sentence used as salt when hashing the user's emails
          (this hash is used to know which files a user can access)
        
        - the name used in the mail for the PDF file.
        
        - a default title/body for the mails.
        
        - a list of browser for which the attachment name should not be
          given. Somehow, Chrome considers the PDF generated by the tool as
          potentially harmful for the computer if the attachment name is
          specified. Adding Chrome here avoids getting a warning.
        
        For wkhtmltopdf user, two extra options are available:
        
        - always use the print CSS to render the PDF.
        
        - use the print CSS for a given set of objects.
        
        xhtml2pdf always use the print CSS.
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        This product has been tested with Plone 3 and Plone 4.
        After version 2.5 (*well, starting at 2.6*), we'll only ensure
        compatibility with Plone 4 (at least in the tests).
        
        
        For developpers
        ===============
        
        You can find some extra doc in
        ``collective/sendaspdf/tests.adapter.txt``. It explains how to define
        custom options in the request or with an adapter.
        
        
        Testing
        =======
        
        If you want to run the sendaspdf test suite, you need to add
        'pdfminer' in the list of eggs in the buildout.
        
        On Plone3, this is my configuration for running the tests (packages do
        not seem to be mandatory as the eggs are taken from the zeoclient
        section)::
        
          [test]
          recipe = collective.recipe.z2testrunner
          zope2part = zeoclient
          packages =
        
        
        And on Plone 4::
        
          [test]
          recipe = zc.recipe.testrunner
          eggs =
              ${zeoclient:eggs}
          defaults = ['--auto-color', '--auto-progress']
          environment = environment
        
          [environment]
          WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH=${wkhtmltopdf:location}/wkhtmltopdf
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.10 (2014-01-20)
        -----------------
        
        - Pass ``--encoding utf-8`` to wkhtmltopdf.  Fixes possible encoding
          error.
          [jean]
        
        
        2.9 (2013-09-27)
        ----------------
        
        - First try to import pisa from the newer xhtml2pdf library.
          Note that it can be hard for both libraries, including their
          dependencies, to find versions that work on Python 2.4 (Plone 3).
          Generally, wkhtmltopdf is recommended.
          [maurits]
        
        - No longer convert everything to ascii for pisa.
          [maurits]
        
        - Do the possible encoding to utf-8 in one spot, before calling
          a html_to_pdf transform method.
          [maurits]
        
        - Do not use deprecated clean_string from jquery.pyproxy anymore.
          Requires jquery.pyproxy 0.3 or higher.
          [maurits]
        
        - When no view_name is given, do not try to get the immediate view,
          but just display the context.  This will let the standard Zope and
          Plone machinery do its work.  Do the same when traversing to 'view'
          does not work even though viewing this url works just fine.  That
          can happen in some cases.
          [maurits]
        
        - Moved code to https://github.com/zestsoftware/jquery.pyproxy
          [vincent, maurits]
        
        
        2.8 (2012-11-01)
        ----------------
        
        - added pep8/pyflakes checks fo Travis based on collective.polls
          config. [vincent]
        
        - pep8/pyflakes [vincent + maurits]
        
        - Added option to allow passing the authentication cookie to
          wkhtmltopdf. This fixes some issues with images hidden inside
          non-public folder (but that the user can see in the normal
          page). [vincent]
        
        
        2.7.2 (2012-10-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix exception syntax for Python 2.4 (Plone 3). [vincent]
        
        
        2.7.1 (2012-10-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed timeout issue. [vincent]
        
        
        2.7 (2012-10-17)
        ----------------
        
        - added some more random in the temporary file generation to avoid
          issue with multiple concurrent runs. [vincent]
        
        - added a timeout on the subprocess + put stdout/err in TemporaryFile
          to avoid potential issues. [vincent]
        
        - raised number of zserver-threads in default buildout, that prevents
          the server locking. [vincent]
        
        - Added bootstrap/buildout based on collective/tutorial.todoapp
          (https://github.com/collective/tutorial.todoapp). [vincent]
        
        
        2.6 (2012-06-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Updated Dutch translations. [Thom van Ledden]
        
        - fix generating local urls with anchors [Davide Moro]
        
        - Bugfix in update_relative_urls [Davide Moro]
        
        2.5 (2012-03-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed generating pdf name [kroman0]
        
        - Added possibility to add an adapter that will generate default
          options for PDF generation.
          Adapter must implement ISendAsPDFOptionsMaker. [vincent]
        
        - Added layout options when generating files with wkhtmlaspdf. Options
          available are: use book style, generate table of contents, margins.
          Those options can be overriden in download links. [vincent]
        
        - Added utility to replace relative URL and include images as data in
          the img tag. [vincent]
        
        - Enabled possibility to render table of contents and book style using
          GET arguments. [vincent]
        
        - Added Italian translation [giacomos]
        
        
        2.4.2 (2011-12-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix is JS bindings to download the PDF, it now uses the correct
          context. [vincent]
        
        - Bugfix when the context title contains non-ascii characters. Zope
          does not accept those characters in set_header [vincent+Vladislav]
        
        
        2.4.1 (2011-12-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix in TinyMCE loading with Plone 4. [vincent]
        
        - Bugfix when checking if the attachment name should be providen,
          'self.excluded_browser_attachment' does not seem to work on every
          instances, used 'self.getExcluded_browser_attachment()'
          instead. [vincent]
        
        - Fixed test runners for Plone 4. [vincent]
        
        
        2.4 (2011-11-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Added a setting in send as PDF tool so we can exclude some browser
          when forcing file name. This will mainly usefull for Chrome, as this
          one considers PDF generated with the tool as potentially harmful
          files.
          The same problem will certainly appear with Chromium. [vincent]
        
        - Display a file name based on the context's title when downloading
          the page. [Giacomo Spettoli]
        
        - Added some functional tests. [vincent]
        
        - Don't repeat POST parameters anymore. [vincent]
        
        
        2.3.1 (2011-06-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix with Unicode (again) and Ajax. [vincent]
        
        
        2.3 (2011-05-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Bugfix when not using secure mail host. [Yuri]
        
        - Bugfix with wk transforms for encoding. [Khairil Yusof]
        
        
        2.2 (2011-04-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed encoding to avoid being limitated to ASCII. [mauriziolupo]
        
        - Added a generic setup handler for sendaspdftool and import/export
          preferences. [mauriziolupo]
        
        
        2.1.1 (2010-12-23)
        ------------------
        
        - added a target (sic :/) attributes on the link to preview the PDF so
          it opens in a new window. That's prety ugly, but the fact is that if
          a user clicks on the link with IE and Acrobat reader installed, it
          will open the PDF in the same window. Hitting the 'back' button will
          display the page without the Ajax form. [vincent]
        
        - in the Ajax popup, we do not try to initialize tinymce is an error
          happenned. [vincent]
        
        - another IE bugfix due to an extra comma + CSS opacity fix [vincent]
        
        
        2.1 (2010-12-15)
        ----------------
        
        - also added meta tag robots:noindex on the forms. [vincent]
        
        - Added header 'X-Robots-Tag': 'noindex' in downloaded file to avoid
          having it indexed by search engines. [vincent]
        
        - Bugfix when sumbitting the Ajax form with TinyMCE. [vincent]
        
        
        2.0.1 (2010-11-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix in jquery.sendaspdf.js - removed one comma that was causing
          an error in IE. [vincent]
        
        
        2.0 (2010-10-22)
        ----------------
        
        - compatibility fixes with Plone4. [vincent]
        
        - added Ajax version of "Download as PDF" link. [vincent]
        
        - added Ajax version of the "Send as PDF" link. [vincent]
        
        - Removed the '-C' parameter. [yuri + vincent]
        
        
        1.1 (2010-09-16)
        ----------------
        
        - when the PDF generation failed in the page to send by mail, we
          display an error page instead of failing. [vincent]
        
        - bugfix in send page - it was impossible to load the Wysiwyg for
          anonymous users. Stole some code from POI to solve it. [vincent]
        
        
        1.0.3 (2010-08-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix broken release with missing files. (Now released with setuptools-git
          installed.) [mark]
        
        
        1.0.2 (2010-08-02)
        ------------------
        
        - updated egg information in setup.py (author and description). [mark]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2010-08-02)
        ------------------
        
        - translated the "download as PDF" action. [mark]
        
        - registered the translations so they are applied. [mark]
        
        
        1.0 (2010-07-21)
        ----------------
        
        - added Dutch and French translations [vincent+mark]
        
        - added view to send by mail and download the page. [vincent]
        
        - added document actions to send the page by mail and download as
          pdf. [vincent]
        
        - Added sendaspdf tool to manage preferences. [vincent]
