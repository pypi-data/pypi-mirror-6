Description: Pumphandle
        ==========
        A (very) work in progress collection of tools for computational and mathematical
        Epidemiology.
        
        Contents
        --------
        Utilities:
        
        - "NetDrop": A simple function for downloading data files from web sources
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        requests
        
        
        Versions
        --------
        0.0.1 - Initial PyPi release version.
        0.0.2 - Minor changes to NetDrop code.
        
        Version Notes
        -------------
        0.0.1 - This release is intended primarily to make the developers life slightly
        easier by packaging a commonly used function for repeated use. It's not a
        general-purpose release, and unless you really hate writing very short bits of
        requests code, it's likely not worth your trouble.
        
        0.0.2 - As with version 0.0.1, but with some slightly more sophisticated
        handling of what to do if a data file already exists, avoid accidental
        overwrites or wasted bandwidth from pulling down redundantly huge files. Also
        cleaned up code with Flake8.
        
        Why 'Pumphandle'?
