	* datetime_periods/time_range.py (TimeRange): Add TimeRange class
	to smartly handle ranges of time. Main example is opening hours a
	location opens at 17:00 and closes at 03:00, it closes at another
	date.
	* datetime_periods/time_range.py (TimeRange._timestamps): Honor
	the localize attribute from timezones in pytz.
