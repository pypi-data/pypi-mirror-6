Doorstop is a tool to manage the storage of textual requirements
alongside source code in version control.

Each requirement item is stored as a YAML file in a designated
directory. The items in each designated directory form a document.
Document items can be linked to one another to form a document
hierarchy. Doorstop provides mechanisms for modifying this hierarchy,
checking the tree for consistency, and publishing documents in several
formats.



Getting Started
===============

Requirements
------------

-   Python 3.3
-   A version control system for requirements storage


Installation
------------

Doorstop can be installed with 'pip':

    $ pip install Doorstop

After installation, Doorstop is available on the command-line:

    $ doorstop --help

And the package is available under the name 'doorstop':

    $ python
    >>> import doorstop
    >>> doorstop.__version__



Document Creation
=================

Parent Document
---------------

After configuring version control, a new parent document can be created:

    $ doorstop new REQ ./reqs
    created document: REQ (@/reqs)

Items can be added to the document and edited:

    $ doorstop add REQ
    added item: REQ001 (@/reqs/REQ001.yml)

    $ doorstop edit REQ1
    opened item: REQ001 (@/reqs/REQ001.yml)


Child Documents
---------------

Additional documents can be created that link to other documents:

    $ doorstop new TST ./reqs/tests --parent REQ
    created document: TST (@/reqs/tests)

Items can be added and linked to parent items:

    $ doorstop add TST
    added item: TST001 (@/reqs/tests/TST001.yml)

    $ doorstop link TST1 REQ1
    linked item: TST001 (@/reqs/tests/TST001.yml) -> REQ001 (@/reqs/REQ001.yml)



Document Validation
===================

To check a document hierarchy for consistency, run the main command:

    $ doorstop
    valid tree: REQ <- [ TST ]



Document Publishing
===================

A text report of a document can be displayed:

    $ doorstop publish TST
    1       TST001

            Verify the foobar will foo and bar.

            Links: REQ001

Other formats are also supported:

    $ doorstop publish TST --html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ...
    <body>
    <h1>1 (TST001)</h1>
    <p>Verify the foobar will foo and bar.</p>
    <p><em>Links: REQ001</em></p>
    </body>
    </html>

Or a file can be created using one of the supported extensions:

    $ doorstop publish TST path/to/tst.md
    publishing TST to path/to/tst.md...

Supported formats:

-   Text: **.txt**
-   Markdown: **.md**
-   HTML: **.html**
