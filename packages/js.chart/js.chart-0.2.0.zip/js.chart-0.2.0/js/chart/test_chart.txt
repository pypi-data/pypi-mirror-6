How to use?
===========

This should be setup before rendering a page. See `fanstatic`_ for more
information::

  >>> from fanstatic import init_needed
  >>> needed = init_needed(base_url='http://localhost')

You can import chart from ``js.chart`` and ``.need`` it
where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.chart import chart_js
  >>> chart_js.need()

Render the inclusion::

  >>> print needed.render()
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost/fanstatic/chart/Chart.js"></script>
