Introduction
============

ZTFY.bootstrap is mainly a new set of Fanstatic resources for Twitter Bootstrap
(including Glypicons set of icons and CSS for responsive design).

It also defines a new browser layer, and a set of forms templates to be used with 
this skin, which also relies on ZTFY.skin package.

Finally, ZTFY.bootstrap provides a new basic skin for ZTFY.blog (but because of
conditional includes, usage of ZTFY.blog is not mandatory to use ZTFY.bootstrap 
package).
