Description: # PNG Renderer
        
        For constructing a zip file of png images. I created this package as I had many plots associated from the output of a plotting script and wanted to keep them together. Similar to `matplotlib.backends.PdfPages` I wanted to associate the images, but using the `png` format, so I chose to zip the collection of images. I wanted png images as they contained large amounts of data which created extremely large pdf files.
        
        ## Example usage
        
        ``` python
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from pngrenderer import PNGRenderer
        
        fig = plt.figure()
        
        plt.plot(...)
        
        # Save the resulting image(s) to "out.zip"
        renderer = PNGRenderer("out")
        
        # Save the first png image
        renderer.savefig("first.png")
        
        # Alternatively call .save_page
        # renderer.save_page("first.png")
        
        # Render the zip file to disk
        renderer.render()
        
        # Alternatively use the context manager
        from pngrenderer import png_render
        
        with png_render("out") as renderer:
            renderer.savefig()
        
        # The context manager calls the `render` method
        ```
        
        
        ## Requirements and installation
        
        This package requires matplotlib, but no other packages
        
        Installation: `pip install git+https://github.com/mindriot101/pngrenderer.git`
        
        If this package ever makes it onto pypi then probably the installation will be `pip install matplotlib-pngrenderer`.
