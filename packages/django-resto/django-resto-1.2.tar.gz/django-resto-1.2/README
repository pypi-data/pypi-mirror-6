django-resto: replicated media storage for Django
#################################################

Introduction
============

django-resto (REplicated STOrage) provides file storage backends that can
store files coming into a Django site on several servers in parallel, using
HTTP. ``HybridStorage`` and ``AsyncStorage`` will store the files locally on
the filesystem and remotely, while ``DistributedStorage`` will only store them
remotely.

This works for files uploaded by users through the admin or through custom
Django forms, and also for files created by the application code, provided it
uses the standard `storage API`_.

django-resto is useful for sites deployed in a multi-server environment, in
order to accept uploaded files and have them available on all media servers
for subsequent web requests that could be routed to any machine.

`django-resto`_ is a fork of `django_dust`_ with a strong focus on
consistency, while django_dust is more concerned with availability.

django-resto is released under the BSD license, like Django itself.

How to
======

Recommended setup
-----------------

In an infrastructure for a Django website, each server has one (or several) of
the following roles:

- Frontend servers handle directly HTTP requests for media and static files,
  and forward other requests to the **application servers**. For django-resto,
  the interesting part is that they are serving media files, so we call them
  **media servers**.
- Application servers run the Django application. This is where django-resto is
  installed.
- Database servers support the database.

If you have several application servers, you should store a **master copy** of
your media files on a NAS or a SAN attached to all your application servers. If
you have a single application server, you can also store the master copy on the
application server itself.

In both cases, use ``HybridStorage`` to replicate uploaded files on all the
media servers. Serving the media files from the local filesystem is more
efficient than serving them from a NAS or a SAN. This is the main advantage of
django-resto.

A little bit of theoretical background
--------------------------------------

Django's built-in ``FileSystemStorage`` goes to great lengths to avoid race
conditions and ensure data integrity.

It is difficult for django-resto to provide the same guarantees, because of the
`CAP theorem`_. Instead, its storage backends can be configured to adjust the
trade-off between the following properties:

- **Consistency**: this is a intrisic weakness of django-resto, because it uses
  plain HTTP, which doesn't provide transaction support, all the more with
  several hosts. However, it targets *eventual consistency*.
- **Availability**: django-resto generally improves the system's availability
  by replicating the data on several servers. It parallelizes storage actions
  to minimize response time. It also provides an asynchronous mode.
- **Partition tolerance**: django-resto is designed to cope with hardware or
  network failure. You can choose to maximize availability or consistency when
  such problems occur.

.. _CAP theorem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem

Media directories synchronization
---------------------------------

You can configure the behavior of django-resto when a media server is
unavailable:

- If ``RESTO_FATAL_EXCEPTIONS`` is ``True``, which is the default value,
  django-resto will raise an exception whenever an operation doesn't succeed
  on all media servers. From the user's point of view, this usually results in
  an HTTP 500 error, unless you have some advanced error handling. This
  ensures that a failure won't go unnoticed.

- If ``RESTO_FATAL_EXCEPTIONS`` is ``False``, django-resto will log a message
  at level ``ERROR`` for each failed upload. This is useful if you want high
  availability: if one media server is down, you can still upload and delete
  files.

In either case, since each operation is run in parallel on all media servers,
it may succeed on some and fail on others. This results in an inconsistent
state on the media servers. When you bring a broken server back online, you
must re-synchronize the contents of its ``MEDIA_ROOT`` from the master copy,
for instance with ``rsync``. You can also set up a cron if you get random
failures during load peaks. This provides eventual consistency.

Obviously, if you bring an additional media server online, you must
synchronize the content of its ``MEDIA_ROOT`` from the master copy.

django_dust keeps a queue of failed operations to repeat them afterwards. This
feature was removed in django-resto. It was prone to data loss, because the
order of ``PUT`` and ``DELETE`` operations matters, and retrying failed
operations later breaks the order. So, use ``rsync`` instead, it's fast
enough.

Asynchronous operation
----------------------

Once the master copy of a file is saved, you may prefer to upload it to the
media servers in the background and continue your processing in the meantime.
This behavior is implemented by ``AsyncStorage``.

It improves response times, but it has two drawbacks:

- Replication lag: a client might be unable to access a file that was just
  uploaded because it hasn't been transferred to the media servers yet.
- No error handling: ``RESTO_FATAL_EXCEPTIONS`` is ignored and upload errors
  are always logged.

This works best in combination with a task queue. To use django-resto with a
task queue, all you need is to subclass ``AsyncStorage`` and override its
``execute_one`` method. For instance, the following should work with rq_::

    from django_resto.storage import AsyncStorage
    from redis import Redis
    from rq import Queue

    queue = Queue(connection=Redis())

    class RqAsyncStorage(AsyncStorage):

        def execute_one(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
            return queue.enqueue(func, *args, **kwargs)

.. _rq: http://python-rq.org/

Low concurrency situations
--------------------------

You may have several servers for high availability or read performance, but
still expect a low concurrency on write operations. This is a common pattern
for editorial websites. In such circumstances, you can decide not to store a
master copy of your media files on the application server. This behavior is
implemented by ``DistributedStorage``.

Be aware of the consequences:

- It is very highly discouraged to set ``RESTO_FATAL_EXCEPTIONS`` to ``False``,
  because you could lose uploaded files entirely without an exception. As a
  consequence, you can't have high availability for write operations.
- Race conditions become possible: if two people upload different files with
  the same name at the same time, you may randomly end up with one file or the
  other on each media server.
- Checking if a file exists becomes more expensive, because it requires an HTTP
  request.

Setup
=====

Installation guide
------------------

django-resto works with Django 1.4 or later, and with any supported Python
version except 2.5.

1.  Download and install the package from PyPI::

        $ pip install django-resto

2.  Set a default file backend, if you want all your models to use it::

        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'django_resto.storage.HybridStorage'

    This is optional. You can also enable a backend only for selected fields
    in your models.

3.  Define the list of your media servers::

        RESTO_MEDIA_HOSTS = ['media-%02d:8080' % i for i in range(12)]

    OK, maybe you don't have 12 servers just yet.

4.  Make sure you have configured ``MEDIA_ROOT`` and ``MEDIA_URL``.

5.  Set up your media servers to enable file uploads. See `Configuring the
    media servers`_ for some examples.

Backends
--------

django-resto defines three backends in ``django_resto.storage``.

``HybridStorage``
.................

With this backend, django-resto will run all file storage operations on
``MEDIA_ROOT`` first, then replicate them to the media servers.

``AsyncStorage``
.................

With this backend, django-resto will run all file storage operations on
``MEDIA_ROOT`` and lanch their replication to the media servers in the
background. See `Asynchronous operation`_.

``DistributedStorage``
......................

With this backend, django-resto will only store the files on the media servers.
See `Low concurrency situations`_.

Settings
--------

``RESTO_MEDIA_HOSTS``
.....................

Default: ``()``

List of host names for the media servers.

The URL used to upload or delete a given media file is built using
``MEDIA_URL``. It is the same URL used by the end user to download the file,
except that the host name changes. It isn't possible to use HTTPS at this
time.

``RESTO_FATAL_EXCEPTIONS``
..........................

Default: ``True``

Whether to throw an exception when an operation fails on a media server.

Failed operations are always logged.

``RESTO_SHOW_TRACEBACK``
........................

Default: ``False``

Whether to include a traceback when logging an exception during an operation.

``RESTO_TIMEOUT``
.................

Default: ``2``

Timeout in seconds for HTTP operations.

This controls the maximum amount of time an upload operation can take. Note
that all uploads run in parallel.

Configuring the media servers
-----------------------------

The backend uses HTTP to transfer files to media servers. The HTTP server must
support the ``PUT`` and ``DELETE`` methods according to RFC 2616.

In practice, these methods are often provided by an external module that
implements WebDAV (`RFC 2518`_). Unfortunately, WebDAV adds the concept of
"collections" and changes the specification of the ``PUT`` methods, making it
necessary to create a collection with ``MKCOL`` before creating a resource with
``PUT``. Currently, django-resto requires a server that just implements
HTTP/1.1 (`RFC 2616`_).

**It's critical to enable file uploads only from trusted IPs.** Otherwise,
anyone could write or delete files on your media servers.

Here is an example of lighttpd config::

    server.modules += (
      "mod_webdav",
    )

    $HTTP["remoteip"] ~= "^192\.168\.0\.[0-9]+$" {
      "webdav.activate = "enable"
    }

Here is an example of nginx config, assuming the server was compiled
``--with-http_dav_module``::

    server {
        listen 192.168.0.10;
        location / {
            root /var/www/media;
            dav_methods PUT DELETE;
            create_full_put_path on;
            dav_access user:rw group:r all:r;
            allow 192.168.0.1/24;
            deny all;
        }
    }

.. _RFC 2616: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt

Advanced use
============

Extending
---------

django-resto provides a robust base for distributing uploaded files. However,
sites requiring this level of optimization often have custom requirements, and
django-resto cannot cover every use case.

It would be impractical to provide settings to control every variation of the
upload behavior, and it would still allow only a limited set of behaviors.

Instead, the recommended way to extend or modify the behavior of django-resto
is to pick the storage class that best matches your requirements and write a
subclass.

This approach is more flexible. You can to take advantage of the testing tools
provided by django-resto to validate your customizations.

API stability
-------------

Functions or methods that have a docstring are considered stable. Their
behavior won't change unless absolutely necessary, and if it does, the changes
will be documented. They may be used or overridden in subclasses to tweak
django-resto's behavior.

The stable APIs are:

- the ``execute*`` methods of the storage classes,
- all methods of ``django_resto.storage.DefaultTransport``,
- all methods of ``django_resto.http_server.TestHttpServer``,
- the function ``django_resto.settings.get_setting``.
