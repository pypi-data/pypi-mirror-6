Introduction
============

collective.teamwork is an add-on for Plone supporting workspaces with
associated workgroups of users, managed locally.

There are two native types of workspaces: a project, which is a workspace
that is considered top-level and serves as a navigation root, and a normal
workspace, which can be nested within other workspaces, including projects.


Requires
--------

* Plone 4.2+ (currently tested against 4.3).

* Dexterity (plone.app.dexterity) 1.0+
