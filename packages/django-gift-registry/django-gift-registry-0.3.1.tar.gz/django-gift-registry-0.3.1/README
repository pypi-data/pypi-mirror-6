Gift Registry
=============

Gift Registry is a minimal wedding registry app. Guests can browse the list of
gifts you've added, then reserve one by entering their email address. If it's a
one-only type gift, the item is marked as chosen so you don't receive two. No
payments are taken.


Quick start
-----------

1. Add required INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

       INSTALLED_APPS = (
           ...
	   'django.contrib.sites',
           'gift-registry',
	   ...
       )

2. Add a setting to describe your event::

       GIFT_REGISTRY_SETTINGS = {
           'EVENT_NAME': "Alice and Bob's Wedding",
       }

3. Include the gifts URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

       url(r'^gift-registry/', include('gift_registry.urls')),

4. Run `python manage.py syncdb` to create the Gift Registry models.

5. Start the development server and visit
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/gift_registry/gift/ to add gift ideas.

6. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/gift-registry/ to browse the public list.


Customising
-----------

There's a good chance that you'll want to customise the look and feel. You do
this by overriding the built-in templates.

Add your own template directory to settings.TEMPLATE_DIRS and override the base
template here. To do this, first create a "gift_registry" directory in your
templates directory. Then from within the django-gift-registry package, copy
"gift_registry/templates/gift_registry/base.html" into your newly created
"gift_registry" directory. Customise this base.html file with your own HTML and
CSS.
