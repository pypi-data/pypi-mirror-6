Description: ====================================================================
        django-campaign - A basic newsletter app for the Django webframework
        ====================================================================
        
        Django-campaign is an application for the Django webframework to make
        sending out newsletters to a rather small group of subscribers easy.
        It is not a solution to drive your multi-thousand-subscriber campaigns, but
        a few hundred - maybe a few thousand - subscribers should be possible.
        
        Some of the core features are:
        
        * Multipart Emails made easy - just add a plain-text *and* a html-template.
        * Full control over the Subscriber-Model and therefore the template context
        used to render the mails.
        * Add context processors to add whatever you need to a mail template based on
        the recipient. This makes it easy to personalize messages.
        * View the campaigns online
        * German translation for the app (at least for all releases)
        * simple and optional subscribe/unsubscribe handling
        
        Planned features:
        
        * easy i18n support for the emails
        * every recipient should be able to see his personalized message online
