        # Overview
        [PyRECONSTRUCT](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyRECONSTRUCT) provides easy access to data in XML files associated with the program [RECONSTRUCT](http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/tools/reconstruct/reconstruct.stm).
        This package also contains several tools for managing this data:
        * mergeTool - merge series together with built-in conflict resolution (graphical or non-graphical)
        * excelTool - output data into excel workbooks (.xlsx)
        * calibrationTool - rescale contours representing images in a section
        * curationTool - check for various properties of objects in a series
        
        The functions/tools already in place can be used to develop solutions to a wide range of problems associated with RECONSTRUCT data.
        
        To start graphical tool loader, use commands in python shell:
        * `import pyrecon`
        * `pyrecon.start()`
