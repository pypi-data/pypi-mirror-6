Description: Introduction
        ============

        Settings
        ========
        
        Managers can set some default bookmarks that all users should view by default.
        
        These bookmarks can be set in a portal_property called "*mybookmarks_properties*" and should be putted in a list field one per line, with the following sintax: *Title|url_or_path*.
        
        For example:
        
        ``Common Page|/common_documents/common_page``
        
        ``google.com|http://www.google.com``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        If you want to add a site content to bookmarks list, just click on the "*bookmark*" link in document_actions.
        
        To add a new external link, you need to fill the related form in the portlet.
        
        To remove a bookmark, just click on delete icon.
        
        Default bookmarks can't be removed by users.
