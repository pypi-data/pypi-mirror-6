<P> Execution time (in seconds) vs the number of grid nodes for the 
Laplace equation on a rectangular 
boundary. Shown are the CPU times taken by the assembly step, the 
conjugate gradient step (CG) and the SuperLU solver when running
Python 2.1, Python 1.5.2 and Jython (Sun VM 1.3), respectively. Note that 
SuperLU does not refer to SuperLU alone but also to the conversion of 
a dictionary based sparse matrix representation to the column compressed
format used by SuperLU.
