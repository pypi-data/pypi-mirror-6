        ## Installation
        
        If you just want to run the package without prior installation, run:
        
        	git clone https://github.com/cadesalaberry/minervashadow.git
        	python minervashadow
        
        
        ### Simple
        
        	pip install minervashadow
        
        Or
        
        	easy_install minervashadow
        
        
        ### Advanced
        
        If you prefer not to use Pypi, or want to get the latest cutting-edge version, you can pull directly from github:
        
        	pip install git+https://github.com/cadesalaberry/minervashadow
        
        Or you can use the makefile included in the repository, provided you already have git installed:
        
        	git clone https://github.com/cadesalaberry/minervashadow.git
        	cd minervashadow
        	make
        
        And you are good to go !
        
        
        ### Uninstallation
        
        To remove the package, just run:
        
        	pip uninstall minervashadow
        
        Or
        
        	make uninstall
        
        Depending on how you installed it.
        
        
        ### SOCS Server bug
        
        If you want to install minervashadow on your SOCS server, you might run into the same issues I did, providing we don't have root privileges. In order to solve it, I just had to modify my **~/.bashrc** file to look like this:
        
        	# .bashrc
        
        	# Source global definitions
        	if [ -f /usr/socs/Profile ]; then
        	        . /usr/socs/Profile
        	fi
        
        	# User specific aliases and functions
        	export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
        	export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
        
        
        The two last lines are the most important.
        
        
        ## Contribute
        
        To contribute do not hesitate to send me pull requests ! However when doing so, make sure you modify the less code possible, or the request would not be clear.
        
        
        ## Future
        
        The future of this package is uncertain for now, but here is the planning I had for it on the short term if you are interested:
