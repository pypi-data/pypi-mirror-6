        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `uplodify File Upload`_ for `fanstatic`_. Note that
        due to licensing constraints we can only provide the flash version.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`uplodify File Upload`: http://www.uploadify.com
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.uploadify``) are published to some URL.

        How to use?
        ===========
