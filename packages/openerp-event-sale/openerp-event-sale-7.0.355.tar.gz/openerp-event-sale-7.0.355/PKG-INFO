Description: 
        
        Creating registration with sale orders.
        =======================================
        
        This module allows you to automate and connect your registration creation with
        your main sale flow and therefore, to enable the invoicing feature of registrations.
        
        It defines a new kind of service products that offers you the possibility to
        choose an event category associated with it. When you encode a sale order for
        that product, you will be able to choose an existing event of that category and
        when you confirm your sale order it will automatically create a registration for
        this event.
