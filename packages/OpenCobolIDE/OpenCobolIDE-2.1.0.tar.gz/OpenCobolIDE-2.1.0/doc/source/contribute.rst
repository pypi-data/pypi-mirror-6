Contributing
==================

OpenCobolIDE is an open-source project, and it needs your help to go on growing
and improving.

You can contribute in many different ways:

    - reports new bugs/features on the `issue tracker`_
    - fork the project and send pull requests to merge your work

If you have any question, just open an issue on the issue tracker.

.. _`issue tracker`: https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/OpenCobolIDE/issues

Recommendation for submitting a post request:
-------------------------------------------------
Pull Requests are great (on the dev branch)! Readme/Documentation changes are
ok in the master branch.

    - Fork the Repo on github.
    - Add your name to AUTHORS.txt
    - Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the dev branch.

The master branch is used for the stable releases, following the
`git workflow`_.

Please use **PEP8** to style your code.
