Description: MultiPserve
        ===========
        
        
        How To
        ------
        
        First, you can use the python script in your root directory for start servers
        
            multipserver.py --apps app1 app2 app3 app4
        
        
        *app's* are directory of applications
        
        
        After, multipserver create pid and log file with name of each application
        
            app1.pid app1.log
        
        
        For kill, you can try this:
        
            multipserver.py (-k|--kill) app1 app2 app3
        
        
        If app killed successfully
        
            kill app1 with pid 41235
        
        Issues
        ------
        Multi Pserve works but not how I think...  
        
        I want it to has a web page or even at the terminal
        (which I think unlikely/not functional) show the logs of active servers.
        
        Look `issues <https://github.com/marioidival/multi_pserve/issues/>`_  for more details.
        
        
        1. All application now are loaded in --reload mode
        #. ``multipserver`` create .log and .pid file for each application
        #. multipserver work with arguments
        #.  ``--apps`` or ``--kill``
