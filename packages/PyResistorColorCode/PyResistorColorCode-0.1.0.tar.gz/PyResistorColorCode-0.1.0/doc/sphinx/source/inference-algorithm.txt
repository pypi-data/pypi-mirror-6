The inference algorithm works as follow:

* code orientation (left-right or right-left) doesn't matter,
* unset bands are not take into account,
* at least 3 colours must be provided: 2 digits and the multiplier,
* colour band are interpreted by priority as:

 #. resistance value,
 #. resistance tolerance,
 #. temperature coefficient,

* the resistance value must exists in a IEC 60063 series: E6, E12, E48, E96, E192,
* the resistance tolerance must be defined if there is a colour band assigned to it. 

When there is more than one hypothesis for the given input, the hypotheses are sorted by ascending
precision (series).
