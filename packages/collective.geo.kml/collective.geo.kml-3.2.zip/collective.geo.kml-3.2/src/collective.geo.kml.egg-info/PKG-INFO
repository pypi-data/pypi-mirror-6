        0.2 (2010-10-31)
        ----------------
        * removed zgeo.kml dependency
        * removed Large Plone Folder configurations
        * added ability to select what content properties to display either in the
          Control Panel or on a per-content basis.  Properties can be changed at will
          and likewise reordered as required.
          [rockdj]
        * display a Collection's saved rich text on the KML view, if it exists.
          [rockdj]
        * retrieve default customised styles from those set in the site's control
          panel.
          [rockdj]
        * moved the link to the given content in the KML view to be the title.
          [rockdj]
        * added further unit tests to test the KML document view (in conjunction with
          testing customised styles)
          [rockdj]
        * added ability to display custom styles for content in the KML-openlayers
          view, with the styles managed through the relevant annotation.
          [rockdj]
        * added standard above-content elements to the KML-openlayers view
          (byline, description, etc).
          [rockdj]
        * updated the kml_openlayers.js Javascript to handle the case of
          accessing the KML-openlayers view directly.
          [rockdj]
        * changed KML links to content to point to the content's *View* action
          if their portal type is set that way in the Site Properties.  This
          follows in the same manner as views like the Folder Summary View.
          [rockdj]
        * added *dc* object to BrainPlacemark to allow access to original
          content item in KML view.  This allows direct access to the content's
          methods and properties (eg for image display, see below)
          [rockdj]
        * allowed KML feature/placemark description to display image thumbnail
          if the content possesses such (eg Images and News Items).  Images are
          displayed in same style as that of the Folder Summary View.
          [rockdj]
        * added extra metadata into KML feature/placemark output (item type,
          modification date, creation date)
          [rockdj]
        * changed KML output to exclude feature/placemark description tag
          on no content description being present.
          [rockdj]
        * added uninstall GenericSetup profile
          [rockdj]
        * added action for downloading KML to desktop (for Google Earth or
          other applications)
          [rockdj]
        * added ability to set marker image size in control panel
          [rockdj]
        * allowed for marker image not have to be in the hard-coded /img/ directory.
          This allows for custom markers to be specified anywhere in Plone.
          img/marker.png is set as default to keep things the same.
          [rockdj]
        * changed linewidth to be able to accept float values.
          [rockdj]
        * integrated zgeo.plone.kml package.
        * updated the kml_openlayers.js Javascript to use the current URL's
          context to access @@kml-document.  Accessing this in a relative manner
          represents problems for URLs being rewritten in a proxy (eg Deliverance).
          [rockdj]
        * renamed Kml Layer
        
        0.1 (2009-06-19)
