        3.0.1 (2013/05/23)
        ------------------
        
        * Refactor import code defining methods on the correct classes. This
          removes lot of workflow managing methods they were handled on the
          wrong class, adding those methods on classes for content who didn't
          even had a workflow.
        
        * Support for missing workflow and metadata information during import.
        
        * Support for skipping content during import.
        
        * Fix various bugs regarding workflow and metadata import.
        
        
        3.0 (2013/03/06)
        ----------------
        
        * Initial release.
