PyFAI is a library to deal with diffraction images for data reduction.
This chapter describes the project from the computer engineering point of view.

Project structure
=================

PyFAI is an open source project licensed under the GPL mainly written in Python (v2.6 or 2.7) and heavily relying on the
python scientific ecosystem: numpy, scipy and matplotlib. It provides high performances image treatment thanks to cython and
OpenCL... but only a C-compiler is needed to build that.

Programming language
--------------------

PyFAI is a Python project but uses many programming languages:

* 10200 lines of Python (without the tests)
* 3500 lines of cython which are converted into
* 252000 lines of C
* 880 lines of OpenCL kernels

Repository:
-----------

The project is hosted by GitHub:
https://github.com/kif/pyFAI

Which provides the issue tracker in addition to Git hosting.
Collaboration is done via Pull-Requests in github's web interface:

Anybody can fork the project and adapt it to his own needs (people from CEA-saclay or Synchrotron Soleil did it).
If developments are useful to other, new developments can be merged into the main branch.

Run dependencies
----------------

* Python2.6 or python2.7
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* FabIO
* pyOpencl (optional)
* fftw (optional)

Build dependencies:
-------------------
In addition to the run dependencies, pyFAI needs a C compiler which supports OpenMP (gcc>=4.2, msvc, ...)

C files are generated from cython source and distributed. Cython is only needed for developing new binary modules.

Building procedure
------------------

As most of the python projects:
..

    python setup.py build install

Test suites
-----------

To run the test an internet connection is needed as 200MB of test images will be downloaded. 
..

    python setup.py build test

Setting the environment variable http_proxy can be necessary (depending on your network):

.. 
 
   export http_proxy=http://proxy.site.org/3128
   
PyFAI comes with 19 test-suites (109 tests in total) representing a coverage of 65%.
This ensures both non regression over time and ease the distribution under different platforms:
pyFAI runs under linux, MacOSX and Windows (in each case in 32 and 64 bits)

Continuous integration is made by a home-made scripts which checks out the latest release and builds and runs the test every night.
Nightly builds are available for debian6-64 bits in:
