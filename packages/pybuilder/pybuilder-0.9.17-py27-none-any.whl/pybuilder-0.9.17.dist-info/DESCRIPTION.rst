PyBuilder is a continuous build tool for multiple languages.

PyBuilder primarily targets Python projects but due to its extensible
nature it can be used for other languages as well.

PyBuilder features a powerful yet easy to use plugin mechanism which
allows programmers to extend the tool in an unlimited way.
