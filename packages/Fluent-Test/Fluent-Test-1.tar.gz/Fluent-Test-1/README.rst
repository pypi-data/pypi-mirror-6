Fluent Unit Testing
===================

*Readable hybrid testing*

Why?
~~~~

This is an attempt to make Python testing more readable while maintaining a
Pythonic look and feel.  As powerful and useful as the `unittest`_ module is,
I've always disliked the Java-esque naming convention amongst other things.

While truly awesome, attempts to bring BDD to Python never feel *Pythonic*.
Most of the frameworks that I have seen rely on duplicated information between
the specification and the test cases.  My belief is that we need something
closer to what `RSpec`_ offers but one that feels like Python.
