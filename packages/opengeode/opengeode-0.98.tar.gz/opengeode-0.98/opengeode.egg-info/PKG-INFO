Description: OpenGEODE
        =========
        
        OpenGEODE is a tiny open-source SDL editor that is developed for
        the purpose of providing an easy to use and free state machine editor and
        Ada code generator to the TASTE toolchain from the European Space Agency,
        running in combination with ESA's ASN.1 "Space Certifiable" ASN.1 compiler.
        
        SDL is the Specification and Description Language (Z100 standard from ITU-T).
        
        This is NOT related to the graphical Simple DirectMedia Layer libraries!

        Installation
        ============
        
        Pre-requisites
        --------------
        
        There are three majors dependencies for OpenGEODE:
        
        - Pyside (the Qt bindings for Python) and the ANTLR runtime to be
        - Python ANTLR Runtime
        - PyGraphviz
        
        If you use pip to install OpenGEODE, these dependencies should be installed
        automatically. However, note that installing PySide from pip requires some
        work and is not straightforward.
        
        If you are using a Linux Debian-based distribution (including Ubuntu),
        I would recommended to install PySide using your package manager:
        You should also install pygraphviz using the same method, for convenience.
        
        $ sudo apt-get install python-pyside python-pygraphviz
        
        And to install pip:
        
        $ sudo apt-get install pip
        
        The Python 2.7 ANTLR 3.1.3 runtime is not part of Debian packages. Install
        it with pip (or download and install manually the package):
        
        $ pip install antlr_python_runtime
        
        On Windows:
        
        You need to download and install Python, Pyside, and pip (binaries are
        available on respective websites)
        
        On FreeBSD:
        
        PySide is available through the ports.
        You can also use easy_install to install it.
        Use pip to install the ANTLR runtime (see above)
        
        Automatic installation (recommended)
        ------------------------------------
        
        $ pip install singledispatch
        $ pip install opengeode
        
        This is sufficient to get opengeode running
        
        In addition OpenGEODE is capable of generating code for embedded, real-
        time systems in the Ada programming language, with compact and efficient
        data manipulation and binary encoding using the ASN.1 notation.
        
        To get the full benefits of SDL and OpenGEODE, consider installing
        TASTE, that is a complete development environment dedicated to
        real-time, embedded systems from the European Space Agency.
        
        TASTE also allows the transparent integration and communication between
        models developed by commercial tools such as Matlab-Simulink and 
        Real-Time Developer Studio.

        The background pattern was downloaded from www.subtlepatterns.com
        
        Developer documentation is provided for the moment in docstrings
        in the Python modules.
        
        The ASN.1 compiler (ASN1Scc) that OpenGEODE is based on was
        developed by George Mamais and Thanassis Tsiodras for the European
        Space Agency. Information at http://www.semantix.gr/asn1scc

        =========
        
        0.98 (08/07/2014)
             - Added support for FOR loops
               In a task, use "for x in range([start], stop, [range]): ... endfor"
               or "for x in sequenceOfvariable: ... endfor"
             - Default symbol size is smaller
             - Various minor bugfixes
        0.97 (07/12/2013)
             - added support for default value when declaring a variable
               e.g. DCL myVar myType ::= { x 5, y 2 };
               default value must be a ground expression
