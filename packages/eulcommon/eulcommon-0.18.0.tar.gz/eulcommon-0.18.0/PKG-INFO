Description: EULcommon
        =========
        
        EULcommon is a `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ module with a few
        small utilities that might be useful to others, but were not large or
        significant enough to warrant splitting out into their own
        repositories at this time.  These components may be broken out at a
        later date.
        
        **eulcommon.binfile** provides the capability to map arbitrary binary
        data into a read-only python object.
        
        **eulcommon.djangoextras** consists of a small number of extensions
        and add-ons for use with `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_,
        such as custom auth decorators, additional form fields, and additional
        HTTP responses.
