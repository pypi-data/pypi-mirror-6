Description: silva.resourceinclude
        =====================
        
        silva.resourceinclude collect and merge resources files (CSS, KSS, JS)
        on layers. It was based on `z3c.resourceinclude`_. It's used by
        ``silva.core.layout`` to easily include resources in Silva Layouts.
        
        It provides as well a full implementation of the Zope resource export
        mechanism for Zope 2, that properly implement HEAD requests and are
        optimized for caching purpose.
        
        Please refer to the official Silva documentation to see how to use it.

        Changes
        =======
        
        2.2.1 (2010/12/20)
        ------------------
        
        * Prevent a bug with Grok if ``CHAMELEON_DEBUG`` is set.
        
        * Improve resources merging to prevent where some resources where
          not included in the merged version.
        
        2.2 (2010-10-27)
        ----------------
        
        * Resource merging is now done when the server is starting. That
          prevent issues in case of multi Zope instance installation.
          Usefull logging is done to know what is merged and how.
        
        * Support for the directive ``only_for`` have been added. It  is the
          equivalent of the ``context`` option used with ZCML directives.
          
        
        2.1 (2010-10-07)
        ----------------
        
        * Bug fix on windows: fix merged resources to be able to properly
          access other relatives resources.
        
        * Bug fix on windows: fix mode used to open files in order to fully
          get all resource data out of them.
        
        * Vary cache key on ``HTTP_HOST`` for the resource include provider
          (that let you access the same site with different hostname and get
          URL for the hostname you asked in your response).
        
        * plone.memoize is replaced with silva.core.cache.
        
        * It is now to include a ressource only for a given content. The ZCML
          is extended with a ``context`` option that let you do that.
        
        * A new ZCML directive called ``resourceLayerInclude`` let you
          reinclude for a different layer and content a list of resources
          defined on an interface with the martian directive.

        ----------------

        * Improve caching (HTTP headers, HEAD requests, 304),
