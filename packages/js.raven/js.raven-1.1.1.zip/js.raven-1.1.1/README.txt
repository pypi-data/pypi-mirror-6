js.raven
********

Introduction
============

This library packages `raven-js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`raven-js`: https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.raven``) are published to some URL.
