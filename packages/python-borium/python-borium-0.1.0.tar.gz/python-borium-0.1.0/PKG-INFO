        =============
        
        Borium provides an API for the borium queue. It exposes simple get/set
        methods to grab and push jobs.
        
        Borium is a simple queue system written by Kazuyoshi Tlacaelel. To
        learn more, visit `the project repository <https://github.com/freshout-dev/borium>`_.
        
        Usage
        =====
        ::
        
            import borium
        
            response = borium.put(job_type, config)  # sends the job to the queue
            job = borium.get(job_type)               # fetches a job
        
        In both examples, job_type is a string that specifies the job that is to
        be enqueued. The config, though dependent on the job itself, is usually
        a JSON object containing the configuration needed.
        
        All requests to the queue will return an object containing a key called
        status. In the case of get this can be: nothing, unparseable, error or
        found. In the case of put this can be: error or stored.
        
        If the job was found, the object will also include the key "job" which
        includes the config string passed.
