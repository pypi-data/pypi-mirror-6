HP SDN Client
=============

**A Python library that makes interaction with the HP SDN Controller REST API easy**

Author: Dave Tucker, Hewlett Packard

This library is currently developed against the HP SDN Controller v2.0 API

Usage Example
-------------

    import hpsdnclient as hp

    controller = '10.44.254.129'

    auth = hp.XAuthToken(user='sdn', password='skyline', server=controller)

    api = hp.Api(controller=controller, auth=auth)


Sample Application
------------------

Please see examples/short_detour.py

Running the Tests
-----------------

The unit tests can be run with tox. Make sure you have modified hpsdnclient/tests/tests.py before you run.

	tox -e py27 -v -- -v

tox.ini has py26, py27 and py33 environments. Only py26 and py27 have been tested right now

ToDo
----

Items still to do:

- Better unit test coverage
- Implement the cache
- Python 3.3 compatibility
- Documentation (Sphinx)
