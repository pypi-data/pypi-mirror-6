Description: 
        This ORM uses a very minimalistic approach. The general idea is that
        the database schema is defined elsewhere (writing the SQL directly, or
        using some specialized software), and all the transactions are
        implemented either as methods in sub-classes of "Database", or as
        stored procedures.
        
        This ORM allows you to very easily: (1) implement complex database
        transactions, (2) call stored procedures, (3) do simple queries. For
        complex queries you should use database views and stored procedures
        that return tables.
