Description: 
        A set of python modules implementing treaps is provided.
        
        Treaps perform most operations in O(log2(n)) time, and are innately sorted.
        They're very nice for keeping a collection of values that needs to
        always be sorted, or for optimization problems in which you need to find
        the p best values out of q, when p is much smaller than q.
        
        A module is provided for treaps that enforce uniqueness.
        
        A pure python version is included, as is a Cython-enhanced version for performance.
        
        Release 1.38 is pylint'd and is known to run on at least CPython 2.x, CPython 3.x
        and Pypy, Pypy3 (beta) and Jython.
