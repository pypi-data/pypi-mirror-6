Description: prism_rest_client README
        ==================
        
        This client library is meant for interacting with REST APIs implemented using
        the prism_rest library. It may work with other REST APIs as well, but has not
        been tested against such.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
            >>> import prism_rest_client
            >>> api = prism_rest_client.open('http://example.com/api')
            >>>
            >>> distros = dict(((x.name, x.version), x) for x in api.distros)
            >>>
            >>> distro = distros.get(('centos', 6))
            >>>
            >>> pkgs = distro.query('packages', name='bash')
            >>>
            >>> assert pkgs[0].nevra.name == 'bash'
