markdown.blankline
==================

Blank line extension for Markdown.

This extension adds the syntax for an user to add a blank line. This can be in the middle of a text block. 
Just type %% and it will add a <br>. This is especially useful for adding blank lines on their own.

This might create unforeseen <br>'s  with the nl2br extension. As you will get double new lines.
