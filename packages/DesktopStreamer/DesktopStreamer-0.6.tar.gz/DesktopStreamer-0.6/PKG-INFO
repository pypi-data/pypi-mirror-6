        Stream Desktop
        ==============
        
        Capture *audio* and *video* from the desktop and stream it to the local
        network using `avconv`_ and `vlc`_.
        
        
        Python Script
        =============
        
        You can just run the python module and - if you install this package - you
        could also start the provided script from the console or your desktop shell.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Start the package like this ``python -m desktopstreamer [options]``. Or use
        the startup script like this::
        
          stream_desktop [-n|--gui] [-a|-A] [capture options] [stream options]
          stream_desktop --version
          stream_desktop --help
        
        To use it in your desktop shell, a ``.desktop`` file is provided.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        The easiest way to install this package is trough `pip`_::
        
          pip install --user desktopstreamer
        
        Or download the latest `source`_ (or get it trough ``git``) and install it
        like this (from the sources root directory)::
        
          python setup.py install --user
        
        Dependencies
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You don't need to install any Python dependencies.
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `avconv`_ and `vlc`_ are required though. Install them like this:
        
          - Debian / Ubuntu: ``sudo apt-get install libav-tools vlc``
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        You can use the provided `.desktop` files to include the script in your
        desktop shell. Open them in an editor and fill in the correct paths for:
        
        Settings
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        You can use a file to store the settings in a JSON dictionary.
        
        The default location is ``~/.config/DesktopStreamer/settings.json``. The
        supported keys are the *capture* and *stream* long-options (with ``_`` instead
        of ``-``).
        
        .. code-block:: json
        
          {
            "port": 420,
            "res_out": "1280x720"
          }
        
        You can create and edit it manually. If you use the ``--save`` option, the
        current settings are stored automatically (previous settings get overwritten).
        
        The settings from this file are applied, if you use the ``--load`` option.
        
        .. note:: The provided ``.desktop`` file uses it.
        
        
        Shell Script
        ============
        
        You can source the ``stream_desktop.sh`` from the `misc/` directory in your
        ``.bash_aliases`` or similar to get a quick ``stream_desktop`` command. The
        python script has more options though.
