Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Allows to create a user and assign roles directly from the sharing tab for Plone >= 4.1.
        This can work with Plone 4.0.9 with plone.app.users > 1.0.6, < 1.1.x.
        
        Content types have just to implement IAddNewUser to have the functionnality.
        
        If you want to enable it for Folder, you only have to add to your buildout.cfg::
        
          [instance]
          eggs =
              ...
              collective.local.adduser
          zcml =
              ...
              collective.local.adduser
        
        If you don't want the functionnality for Folder, but on your own content type,
        add to the configure.zcml of your policy module::
        
          <include package="collective.local.adduser" file="minimal.zcml" />
          <class class="my.package.content.MyContent.MyContent">
             <implements interface="collective.local.adduser.interfaces.IAddNewUser" />
          </class>
        
        If you don't want the roles field, you can include minimal_wo_roles.zcml instead of minimal.zcml.
