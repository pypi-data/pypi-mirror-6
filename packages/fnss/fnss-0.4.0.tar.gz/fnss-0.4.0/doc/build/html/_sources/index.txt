************************************
Fast Network Simulation Setup (FNSS)
************************************

This is the documentation of the FNSS core library.
It is a Python library providing a set of features allowing to simplify the setup of a network simulation.
These features include the ability to:

* Parse a topology from a dataset, a topology generator or generate it according to a number of synthetic models
* Apply link capacity, link weights, link delays and buffer sizes
* Deploy application stacks
* Generate traffic matrices
* Generate event schedules

In addition to the core library, FNSS comprises APIs written in other languages (Java and C++) and adapters for third-party network simulators (`ns-2 <http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/>`_ and `ns-3 <http://www.nsnam.org/>`_).
The only function of these APIs and adapters is to parse topologies, event schedules and traffic matrices generated by the core library and easily import them in the desired target simulator. FNSS adapters and APIs can be downloaded `here <http://fnss.github.io/>`_.

The FNSS core library is released under the terms of the `BSD license <https://raw.github.com/fnss/fnss/master/core/LICENSE.txt>`_.
