Description: rabbitpy - rabbitmq simplified
        ==============================
        
        A pure python, thread-safe, minimalistic and pythonic BSD Licensed
        AMQP/RabbitMQ library that supports Python 2.6+ and Python 3.2+.
        rabbitpy aims to provide a simple and easy to use API for interfacing with
        RabbitMQ, minimizing the programming overhead often found in other libraries.
        
        |PyPI Version| |Build Status|
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        rabbitpy may be installed via the Python package index with the tool of
        your choice. I prefer pip:
        
        ::
        
            pip install rabbitpy
        
        But there's always easy_install:
        
        ::
        
            easy_install rabbitpy
        
        rmqid Compatibility
        -------------------
        
        rabbitpy is API compatible with rmqid.

        -------------
        
        https://rabbitpy.readthedocs.org
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  `pamqp <https://github.com/pika/pamqp>`_
        
        Simple Examples
        ---------------
        
        The simple methods provide quick and easy access for one-off actions with
        rabbitpy. In addition to the simple methods, there is extensive support for
        all RabbitMQ actions using the rabbitpy object methods.
        
        Simple Publisher
        ################
        
        The simple publisher is ideal for sending one off messages:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> rabbitpy.publish('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f',
                                 exchange='test',
                                 routing_key='example',
                                 body='This is my test message')
        
        If you want to add properties:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> rabbitpy.publish('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f',
                                 exchange='test',
                                 routing_key='example',
                                 body='This is my test message',
                                 properties={'content_type': 'text/plain'})
        
        And publisher confirms:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> rabbitpy.publish('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f',
                                 exchange='test',
                                 routing_key='example',
                                 body='This is my test message',
                                 properties={'content_type': 'text/plain'},
                                 confirm=True)
            True
            >>>
        
        Simple Getter
        #############
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> m = rabbitpy.get('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f', 'test')
            >>> m.json()
            {u'foo': u'bar'}
        
        Simple Consumer
        ###############
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> for message in rabbitpy.consume('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f', 'example', no_ack=True):
            ...     message.pprint(properties=True)
            ...
            Exchange: amq.topic
        
            Routing Key: example
        
            Properties:
        
            {'app_id': '',
             'cluster_id': '',
             'content_encoding': '',
             'content_type': '',
             'correlation_id': '',
             'delivery_mode': None,
             'expiration': '',
             'headers': None,
             'message_id': 'b191f7f4-4e9d-4420-b18a-2ac8783ab3c5',
             'message_type': '',
             'priority': None,
             'reply_to': '',
             'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2013, 12, 18, 21, 48, 5),
             'user_id': ''}
        
            Body:
        
            'This is my test message'
        
        RabbitMQ Objects
        ----------------
        In addition, the API offers support for more complex coding using objects that
        represent either the AMQ Model or RabbitMQ concepts. These include:
        
        - Connections
        - Channels
        - Exchanges
        - Messsages
        - Policies [@TODO]
        - Queues
        - Transactions
        - Users [@TODO]
        - Virtual Hosts [ @TODO]
        
        More complex examples and the rabbitpy API documentation are available at https://rabbitpy.readthedocs.org
