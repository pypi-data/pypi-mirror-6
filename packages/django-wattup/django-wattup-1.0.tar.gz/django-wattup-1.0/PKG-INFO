        =====
        
        A very simple contact form application for django.
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        Add "wattup" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
              INSTALLED_APPS = (
                  ...
                  'wattup',
              )
        
        Include the wattup URLconf in your projects urls.py like so:
        
              url(r'', include('wattup.urls'))
        
        Add this to your projects settings.py: 
        
              EMAIL_USE_TLS = foo
              
              EMAIL_HOST = 'foo'
              
              EMAIL_PORT = foo
              
              EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'foo'
              
              EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'foo'
              
              DEFAULT_TO_EMAIL = 'foo'
              
              DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'foo'
              
              ORG_NAME = 'foo'
        
        *NOTE*
        
              Make sure that these settings are correct!
        
              "DEFAULT_TO_EMAIL" is the email address you want the messages to go to.
        
              "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL" is the email address you want the message to say it is from.
        
        Run 'python manage.py syncdb'
        
        Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact
        
        
        From here, you should be able to send a message using the form you are given. If it does not work, check your settings.py
