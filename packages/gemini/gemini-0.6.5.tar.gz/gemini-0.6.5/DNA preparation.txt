We would like to explore the long read possibilities to untangle repeated genomic areas.
In relation to that I would like to ask people in this forum how they prepare their genomic DNA for long read sequencing. 

DNA isolation	ProtK lysis followed by Phenol, Phenol/Cloroform, Chloroform extractions and EtOH/ammonium acetate precipitation	
Fragmentation	Covaris  G-tube	
Size selection	BluePippin	
DNA repair	Pacbio DNA Damage Repair Mix or NEB PreCR (is this the same?)
