Description: ====================
        SilvaExternalSources
        ====================
        
        The SilvaExternalSources extension for `Silva`_ that gives you the
        possibility to include data from non-Silva sources inside Silva
        documents and Silva pages. These non-Silva or external sources can for
        example be a relational database or the outcome of executing a Python
        script.
        
        Since an external source can potentially be resource intensive or a
        expose a vulnerability, only users with ZMI access (usualy site
        managers) can create external sources. It is their responsibilty to
        make sure no vunerabilities are exposed to the Authors.
        
        An external source object can expose - using a Formulator form - a set
        of parameters to the Author of a Silva Document. The actual use of
        these parameters (and the values set by the Author) is to be specified
        by the external source implementation.
        
        By implementing the IExternalSource interface, one can create new types
        of external sources. See ``interfaces.py`` for more details on this.
        
        The SilvaExternalSources extension currently implements three
        external sources: *Silva Code Source*, *Silva SQL Source* and
        *Silva CSV Source*.  The latter is special in that it also shows
        up as an asset in Silva. This is possible because no code is
        contained in a CSVSource.

        - added support for 'elaborate' code sources, that show their
          add/edit form in a pop-up instead of in the kupu
          toolbox. Useful when code sources have a large number of
          variables.
        
        - component registration now done using Silva 2.0 zcml
          directives SilvaExternalSources no longer works with Silva 1.6

        Features added / bugs fixed: not recorded
        
        1.3

        Features added
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Users get confused when adding a Code Source that has no
          parameters.  They have to click the same button twice, once to
          add, and again to add.  Added a note that informs the user how
          to proceed.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The add form for CSV Sources was broken in that it ignored the
          file upload field.

        0.13
        ----
        
        Features added

        - Changed Silva External Sources to use new i18n machinery.

        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Titles were not stored as unicode strings.
          Moved the setting of the title to *after* the creation
          of the source, so that we can get an encoding from somewhere
          and use it to convert to unicode. Unfortunately this somewhere is a
          hard coded string for now, since Zope 2 doesn't seem to allow
          anything else.
        
        - ZMI parameter forms are now utf-8 by default.
        
        - Fixed unicode bug when using non-ascii chars in field titles (Kupu
          specific, port from 0.10 branch).

        - Fixed unicode bug in SQL statement, this didn't support non-ascii
          characters yet.
        
        - Fixed conditionals in the layout template, setting ``show_caption`` and
          ``show_column_heading`` should now have an effect.

        - i18n, German translation.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The layout pagetemplate for rendering the SQL result set now
          gets more information about the columns names and their
          order. The pagetemplates of existing SQL Source instances need
          to be updated to make use of this information.
