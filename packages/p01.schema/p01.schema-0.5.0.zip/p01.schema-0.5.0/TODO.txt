- implement html5 schema fields and provide implicit widget lookup based on
  j01.form
  
- include p01.schema in j01.form and configure the relevant widgets

- implement html5 properties, see:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input

  should we implement all propertoes in fields or should we oly support some
  of them at form field widget level? I guess properties like autosave should
  be a part of the form and not the schema field, right?
  
  Also think about the pattern property and a hint text.
