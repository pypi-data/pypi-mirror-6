Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

-  v0.7.1

   -  Add `Read The Docs documentation <http://drmaa-python.readthedocs.org>`__
   -  Add ``const`` module identifiers back into package namespace
   -  Remove ``b`` prefixes from strings inserted into error messages.

-  v0.7.0

   -  String attribute issues with Python 3 have all been resolved, and now each
      function that takes a string can handle unicode strings, and returns
      unicode strings.
   -  All code has been updated to use future imports for ``unicode_literals``
      and ``print_function``, so we're effectively writing Python 3 code now.
   -  PEP8 compliance changes all over the place, except those that would break
      names required by underlying C DRMAA library.
   -  Now automatically run unit tests of Travis-CI with SGE, and all tests pass
      for Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3.  SGE is installed using scripts I describe
      in `this gist <https://gist.github.com/dan-blanchard/6586533>`__.
   -  Unit tests are now in a top-level directory instead of a sub-directory
      under the drmaa package.
   -  There is now a `session.py` module that contains most of the code that was
      in ``__init__.py`` before, and ``__init__`` just imports things and sets
      ``__all__`` and ``__version__``, as is typically recommended now.
   -  Drops support for Python 2.5.
