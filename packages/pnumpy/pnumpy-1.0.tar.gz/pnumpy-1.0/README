pnumpy is a very lightweight implementation of distributed arrays, 
which is based on numpy and mpi4py. pnumpy supports arrays in any 
number of dimensions. pnumpy works seemlessly with numpy slicing 
operators ufunc, etc., making it easy to transition from numpy 
arrays to using pnumpy arrays. 

Installation
------------

pnumpy needs python 2.x, mpi4py, and numpy. To install pnumpy type:

[sudo] python setup.py install

or 

python setup.py install --prefix=<install_directory> 

if you wish to install pnumpy under install_directory (make sure 
to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to
 <install_directory/lib/python<version>/site-packages).

Testing
-------

cd tests
mpiexec -n 4 python testDistArray.py
